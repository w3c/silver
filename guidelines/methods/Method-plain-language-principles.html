Code for the tabbed interface for this W3C Silver Prototype was lovingly ripped from https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/ with the example code taken from https://codepen.io/heydon/pen/veeaEa .

<h2>Basics</h2>
<h3>Status</h3>
<ul>
<li>Last Updated: 16 January 2020
<li>New
</ul> 
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>This Method applies to all platforms. Its purpose is to improve the accessibility of text content, particularly instructional content or long text content.  
</p>
<h3>Programming Language</h3>
<p>
Does not apply  
</p>
<h3>How It Solves User Need</h3>
<p>This method addresses a number of user needs for people with a variety of cognitive disabilities.  Much of it follows general principles of good writing.  It includes some of the principles of plain language.  It provides a variety of techniques that when used together makes text content easier to read for all users, but especially for people with disabilities that affect reading comprehension.

<li>Use of White Space (TBD)
</ul>

<section id="section2">
<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use proper grammar for the language, as defined by a style guide or by standard language rules
<li>Use correct spelling
<li>Use active voice. Active Voice:  The subject of the sentence performs the action (verb). Example:  Bob paints the house. Passive Voice:  The subject of the sentence is acted upon by the verb. Example: The house is painted by Bob.
<li>Use simple verb tense, such as “Bob paints the house”, or “Paint the house.” Do not use perfect or continuous tenses unless needed for accuracy. Simple tense verbs describe actions without stating whether the action is completed or ongoing. Example:  Bob paints the house. Perfect Tense verbs describe actions that started in the past and continues into the present. Example: Bob has painted the house. Continuous Tense verbs describe actions that are currently happening."Bob is painting the house."
<li>Use literal and concrete language. When possible, use concrete terms and examples that refer to objects or events that you can see, hear or touch.
<li>Metaphors and similes should not be used unless they are explained.
<li>Limit use of metaphor, similes, sarcasm, or irony.  Using words to mean something different or opposite of their literal meaning is confusing to people with some cognitive disabilities.  
<li>Use common words or terms to represent concepts where it makes sense. When uncommon words are necessary, define them in context. 
<li>Remove unnecessary words such as:
<ul>
<li>Excessive detail (without a summary or heading structure)
<li>Extra words that don’t add meaning, such as: "It is cold" vs. "It is really cold"; "First" vs "First and Foremost"; "Each" vs. "Each and every"
</ul>
<li>Avoid the following when possible. Define or spell out any you use in context: 
<ul>
<li>Technical terms
<li>Jargon
<li>Idioms
<li>Slang
<li>Acronyms
<li>Abbreviations
</ul>
<li>Break text into sections and provide headings. See the guideline on headings and the guideline on white space (to be written).
<li>Keep sentences and paragraphs short.
<li>Number sequential steps.
<li>Provide brief summaries at the top of long documents.
</ol>

<p>
</p>
<h3>Related Methods</h3>
<p>Not a link to every other method for the guideline, but a link to the Methods that it would also need: For example, an accessible modal would have related methods for keyboard accessibility, disabling interaction with the background, providing a close button, etc.

<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>You can evaluate this method using one of the three options below. Any one is sufficient.  
</p>
<ol>
<li>You can use a professional editor to evaluate the content against the following rubric and implement the recommended changes. 
<li>You can develop and use a style guide to your organizations specific needs that implements the following rubric and then test against the style guide.
<li>You can use the following testing rubric. 
</ol>
<h4>Rubric for evaluating clear language</h4>
<p>Rate each of the areas by: </p>
<ul>
<li>Substantially:  A significant effort has been made and most exceptions improve clarity.
<li>Partially: An effort has been made, but there is room for substantial improvement. 
<li>Limited: Inconsistent effort or no effort
</ul>
