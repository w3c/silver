			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 provides a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible to users with disabilities. Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities and cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other Web of Things devices. They address various types of web content including static content, interactive content, visual and auditory media, and virtual and augmented reality. The guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>Each <a>guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a>functional outcomes</a> to measure if the need has been met.  Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a>methods</a> to meet each functional outcome. This specification is expected to be updated regularly to keep pace with technology change, both by updating or adding methods as well as adding guidelines to address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several grades of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>
			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions. They also incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 is expected to substantially conform to a conformance level of WCAG 3.0, though these guidelines have many differences from WCAG 2.x. WCAG 3.0 does not supersede WCAG 2.2 and previous versions; rather, it is an alternative and more modern set of guidelines. Once these guidelines become a W3C Recommendation, the W3C will advise developers, content creators and policy makers to use WCAG 3.0 in order to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts.  However, web sites that conform to earlier versions of
				WCAG continue to conform to those versions.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This specification creates a new framework and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities. W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 supports a wide set of user needs, uses new approaches to testing, and allows frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. WCAG 3.x continues this evolution by focusing on users’ functional needs. These are then supported by technology-specific methods to meet that need. </p>
			<p>Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities. This includes accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, learning disabilities, cognitive disabilities and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make content more usable to users in general as well as accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p>
			<p>WCAG 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions. They also incorporate content from and partially extend<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. These earlier versions provided a flexible framework that kept them relevant for over 10 years. However, changing technology and changing needs of people with disabilities has led to the need for a new framework to address content accessibility more comprehensively and flexibly. </p>
			<p>There are many differences between WCAG 2.x and WCAG 3.x but content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 A &amp; AA is expected to substantially conform to the minimum conformance level of this new standard. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.x, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and / or other approaches to facilitate migration.</p>
			<section><h3>Scope of WCAG 3.0</h3><p>During the year of research conducted by the Silver Community Group and their research partners, a recurring theme was the popularity and quality of the guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were changes in the structure and presentation of accessibility guidance to:</p><ul>
					<li>improve usability — especially for beginners;</li>
					<li>support disability needs that cannot be tested by true/false success criteria; and</li>
					<li>improve maintenance to keep the guidelines more current.</li>
				</ul>The goal of WCAG 3.0 is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products on a variety of platforms. WCAG 3.0 uses a framework that allows it to address more disability needs than WCAG 2.X, as well as address publishing requirements and emerging technologies on the web such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It will also provide non-<a>normative</a> information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. The WCAG 3.0 framework is designed to support better coverage across disabilities and be easier to maintain, so that the new framework will be more durable over time as technologies evolve. [@RM: This sentence was in future tense but that didn't seem to fit. Maybe remove it?] This requires development of a new conformance model, engaging policy makers in that process, and testing the model with policy makers from different settings.</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Relationship to Other W3C Guidelines</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> [[WCAG20]] was designed to be technology neutral, and has stayed relevant for over 10 years. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]] provide guidance for various types of software that assist people in writing accessible content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis. </p>
				<p>These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents and assistive technologies.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG.</li>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 is not backward compatible with WCAG 2.0, ATAG 2.0, and UAAG 2.0.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For more details about differences from previous guidelines, see <a href="#differences-from-wcag-2">Appendix: Differences From WCAG 2</a>.</p>

			<section>
				<h3>Key Requirements</h3>
				<p>Research and design work performed by the Silver Task Force identified key requirements needed to improve upon the existing WCAG 2.x structure. These requirements shaped the conformance proposal that follows and should be taken into account when evaluating and updating this proposal.</p>
				<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/">Requirements for Silver</a> documents the following requirements which are met by this document:</p>

			<h2>Structure of These Guidelines</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Functional Categories</h3>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 is organized by <a>Functional Categories</a> of disabilities which reflect the diverse needs of users with disabilities. Within each Functional Category, <a>Functional Needs</a> are applied to specific topics (for example: contrast, forms, readability, and more)  to identify the barriers experienced by people with disabilities. The barriers in these topics inform the <a>Functional Outcomes</a>, which state the conditions to test whether the Functional Needs have been met.  </p>
				<p class="ednote">The work of cataloging functional needs is still in process and will continue after the First Public Working Draft.  Those interested can see more information in this draft Google document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJkgXqbh7dx3uD6XAy8XAANmwfbbVZ5GKb_gbsUdkVs/">Functional Needs - Expanded</a></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Functional Needs</h3>
				<p>A <a>Functional Need</a> is a statement that describes a specific gap in one’s ability, or a specific mismatch between ability and the designed environment or context.</p>
				<p class="note">The intent is to express the need in a contextual model, as opposed to a lack of ability in a medical model. This is similar to the ICF (International Classification of Functioning – a biopsychosocial model), “outcomes of interactions between health conditions (diseases, disorders and injuries) and contextual factors”, focusing on the interactions. </p>
				<p class="ednote">Need link and reference for ICF</p>
				<blockquote>Example: Use without vision.</blockquote>
				<p>Functional Needs are documented in the supplementary material accompanying the Guidelines and Functional Outcomes.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Guidelines</h3>
				<p><a>Guidelines</a> are high level plain language summaries that address Functional Needs on specific topics, such as contrast, forms, readability, and more.  They organize and group the Functional Outcomes. Guidelines are technology independent.</p>	
				<p>Guidelines will be identified by unique name. Translations should have an appropriate unique name.</p>				
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Functional Outcomes</h3>
				<p><a>Functional Outcomes</a> are the results of practices that reduce or eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience. Functional Outcomes form the basis of a flexible and expansive architecture for accessibility guidelines that relates closely to the needs of people with disabilities. Specific tests can be used to assess the accessibility of common technologies and the overall Functional Outcome can be used to assess proprietary and new technologies. </p>
				<p>Functional Outcomes are <a>normative</a>. They are located in the normative section of specific guidelines.  They are repeated in the Methods that apply to that Guideline.  </p>

				<h3>How-Tos</h3>
				<p>The <a>How-To</a> provides explanatory material for the guideline that applies across technologies. This plain language resource includes information on getting started, who the guideline helps and how, as well information for designers and developers.  </p>
			</section>

				<h3>Methods</h3>
				<p>Each Functional Outcome has one or more <a>Methods</a>. The Methods include detailed techniques and tests for meeting and testing the functional outcome for specific technologies. Existing WCAG 2.2 techniques may be referenced in the appropriate Method for the Functional Outcome. New tests and how to score existing and new tests are included in the Method.  </p>

				<h3>Tests</h3>
				<p>Specific <a>tests</a> and how to score them are included in the Method.  Tests are designed to be more flexible to allow more user needs of people with disabilities to be included in the Guidelines.  Tests can include true /false evaluation or various types of rating scales as appropriate for the Guideline, Functional Outcome, or technology.  Tests may vary by technology as needed.  Each Method includes information on how to score individual instances of the test, and how to score the Functional Outcome in an optional <a href="#conformance-claims">Conformance Claim</a>. </p>

			<h2>Normative Requirements</h2>
			<p>The main content of WCAG 3.0 is <a>normative</a> and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as "non-normative", diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>
			<p>The key words <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST NOT">MUST NOT</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="NOT RECOMMENDED">NOT RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="RECOMMENDED">RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em>, and <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD NOT">SHOULD NOT</em> are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119]].</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>The Guidelines</h2>
			<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include Web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including functional categories of disabilities, general guidelines, functional outcomes that can be tested and a rich collection of methods, and documented common failures with examples, resource links, and code.</p>

			<p class="ednote">The process of migrating information from WCAG 2.x to WCAG 3.0 has just begun. This document presents initial examples of how the structure works. The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/explainers/template.html">template for the new content</a> presents the skeleton of the architecture and may help . We welcome comments on this. </p>
			<p class="ednote">These are early drafts of guidelines. They are used to illustrate what WCAG 3.0 could look like and to test the process of writing content. These guideline drafts should not be considered as final content of WCAG 3.0. They are there to show how the structure would work. As this draft matures, numbering of individual guidelines will be removed to improve overall usability of the guidelines in response to public requests. </p>
			<p>As more content is developed, this section will be a list of guidelines with a unique short name, and the text of the requirement written in plain language. To see the overall plan for migrating content from WCAG 2.1 to WCAG 3.0, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCRXrtmnSSTso-6S_IO9GQ3AKTB4FYt9k92eT_1PWX4/edit">WCAG to Silver Outline Map</a>.</p>

				<h3>Visual Contrast of Text</h3>
				<p>Provide sufficient contrast between foreground text and its background.</p>
				<p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/explainers/visualContrast.html">Visual Contrast of Text How-to</a></p>
				<div class="ednote">
					<p>Visual Contrast is a migration from WCAG 2.1 with significant updates:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>New calculations of contrast based on more modern research on color perception.</li>
						<li>Merging the 1.4.3 AA and 1.4.6 AAA levels into one guideline.</li>
						<li>New test of text contrast.</li>
						<li>At this time, it only includes textual visual contrast.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>We propose changing the name of “Color Contrast” to “Visual Contrast” as a signal of a paradigm change from one about color to one about “perception of light intensity”. The reason for this change is that the understanding of contrast has matured and the available research and body of knowledge has made breakthroughs in advancing the understanding of “visual contrast”.</p>
				<p>The proposed new guidance more accurately models current research in human visual perception of contrast and light intensity. The goal is to improve understanding of the functional needs of all users, and more effectively match the needs of those who face barriers accessing content. This new perception-based model is more context dependent than a strict light ratio measurement; results can, for example, vary with size of text and the darkness of the colors or page.</p>
				<p>This model is more responsive to user needs and allows designers more choice in visual presentation. It does this by including multi-factor assessment tests which integrate contrast with interrelated elements of visual readability, such as font features. It includes tests to determine an upper limit of contrast, where elevated contrast may impact usability.</p>

			<h2>Evaluation</h2>
			<p class="ednote">We continue to test this approach and others for validity, reliability, sensitivity, and adequacy, and complexity.  Alternatives that we are exploring are noted as separate editor’s notes where applicable. We welcome suggestions on ways to improve the scoring to better meet these criteria.</p>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Testing</h3>
				
				<p>WCAG 3.0 tests and scores <a>Functional Outcomes</a>. Functional Outcomes are written as testable criteria that allow testers to objectively determine if the content they are evaluating satisfies the criteria. </p> 
				<p>Testing Functional Outcomes uses both <a>views</a> and <a>processes</a> to define what is being tested.  Views include all content visually and programatically available without a substantive change. Processes are a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity/task from end-to-end. When testing processes, the content used to complete the process as well as all of the associated views need to be included in the test. </p>

				<section>
				<h4>Types of Tests</h4>
								
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests: <a href="#traditional-tests">Traditional Tests</a> and <a href="#holistic-tests">Holistic Tests</a>. Testing the Functional Outcomes using the traditional tests involves a combination of <a>automated testing</a> and <a>human evaluation</a>. <!--The content should be tested by those who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the technology being tested.--></p>
					<p>Although content may satisfy all Functional Outcomes using the traditional tests, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. The holistic tests address this gap by evaluating more of the user experience than traditional testing. </p>
					<section>
						<h5>Traditional Tests</h5>
						<p>Traditional tests evaluate content, often at an <a>object</a> level, for accessibility. Traditional tests include the existing tests that support A, AA, and AAA <a>Success Criteria</a> in WCAG 2.x. They also include tests that may require additional context or expertise beyond tests that fit within the WCAG 2.x structure.  In WCAG 3.0, traditional tests are used to test both processes and views.  Test results are then aggregated across the selected views. Critical errors within selected processes are also totaled. Successful results of the traditional tests are used to reach a <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> rating.</p>
						<p class="ednote">MC: think we need to describe automated vs manual tests here.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Holistic Tests</h5>
						<p>Holistic tests include assistive technology testing, user-centered design methods, and both user and expert usability testing.  Holistic testing applies to the entire declared scope and often uses the declared processes to guide the tests selected.  Successful results of holistic tests are used to reach a <a href="#silver">Silver</a> or <a href="#gold">Gold</a> rating.</p>
					</section>

				</section>
				<section>
				<h4>Technology Specific Testing</h4>				
				<p>Each functional outcome includes <a>methods</a> associated with different technologies. Each method contains <a>tests</a> and <a>techniques</a> for satisfying the functional outcome.  The functional outcome is written so that testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies that do not have related methods based solely on the functional outcome. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Critical Errors</h4>
					
					<p>Evaluating <a>processes</a> requires counting <a>critical errors</a> that occur within the process and associated <a>views</a>. Critical errors are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Errors that stop a user from being able to complete the <a>task</a> if it exists anywhere on the page (examples: flashing, keyboard trap, audio with no pause);</li>
						<li>Errors that when located within a process means the process cannot be completed (example: submit button not in tab order); and</li>
						<li>Errors that when aggregated within a view or across a process cause failure (example: a large amount of confusing, ambiguous language).</li>
					</ul>				
					<p><a>Functional Outcomes</a> specify the related critical errors that can occur and how to identify them. </p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Evaluation Scope</h3>
				<p>Web content that follows the requirements of WCAG 3.0 apply them to a specific scope. While the scope can be an entire web site, it is usually one or more sub-sets of the site. Reasons for this include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Large web sites are impractical to evaluate comprehensively using anything beyond <a href="#traditional-tests">traditional tests</a>;</li>
					<li>The content of many sites changes frequently, causing evaluation to be accurate only for a specific moment in time;</li>
					<li>Some portions of a site content are more important to more users than others;</li>
					<li>Content that mostly meets the requirements but has problems can interfere with the user's ability to complete a process begun elsewhere on the site.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 therefore defines two inter-related ways to scope content: <a href="#views">views</a> and <a href="#processes">processes</a>. Evaluation is done on a complete view or process, and conformance is determined on the basis of a complete view or process. This is defined further in <a href="#defining-conformance-scope">Defining Conformance Scope</a>.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>Views</h4>
					<p>A view is a single interaction with web content. Conceptually, it corresponds to the definition of a "web page" as used in WCAG 2.x, but is not restricted to content meeting that definition. Each change of content as understood by the user comprises a new view.</p>
					<p class="ednote">To flesh out more.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Processes</h4>
					<p>A process is a complete activity the user performs on the web site. Example tasks include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Logging into a site and being recognized as an authenticated user;</li>
						<li>Ordering an item, in which case the process includes the entire set of tasks from searching for the item, adding it to the shopping cart, paying for it, and receiving confirmation;</li>
						<li>Submitting tax information, from start to end of the process;</li>
						<li>Interacting with other users in a comment site or social network.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Process comprise one or more <a href="#views">views</a>.</p>

				<h3>Scoring</h3>
				<p class="ednote">One the goals of WCAG 3.0 is to expand scoring tests of methods beyond a binary true/false choice at the page level. We have included tests within the sample functional outcomes that demonstrate alternatives such as <a>rubrics</a> and <a>scales</a>. We are also exploring integrating these options into <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/">Accessibility Conformance Testing</a> format. We will include example tests in a future draft. Our intent is to include detailed <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/#multiple-ways-to-measure">tests for methods</a> to support each functional outcome within the WCAG 3.0 framework.</p>
				<p>Each <a>functional outcome</a> has <a>methods</a> associated with different <a>technologies</a>. Each method contains <a>tests</a> and <a>techniques</a> for meeting that functional outcome. Testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies that do not have related methods based on the functional outcome.</p>

				<section>
				<h4>Scoring Traditional Tests</h4>
				<p>In most cases, testing individual <a>objects</a> will result in binary, pass / fail outcome for each element. This leads to either a pass / fail or a percentage rating depending on the test. A rating scale may be provided for some tests to allow the tester to assign a quality judgement of an element or block of content. Each of these results can be assigned a percentage and the percentages to help determine the overall score of a functional outcome.</p>
					<p class="ednote">The above needs to be revisited, the Silver groups hadn't quite gotten onto the same page prior to writing.</p>
					<p>Outcomes of tests:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tests that results in a pass or fail condition will be assigned a 100% or 0%;</li>
						<li>Tests at the element level that can be consistently counted will be assigned a percentage (number passed / total number of instances);</li>
						<li>Tests that apply to content without clear boundaries will be scored using a <a>rating scale</a>. The rating scales may vary based on the test and may be presented as numeric scale, an <a>adjective-based</a> rating system, or a <a>rubric</a>. Each of these can be converted into a percentage to make it easier to compare across tests.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h4>Scoring Functional Outcomes</h4>
				<p>The results from the traditional tests are aggregated across views and used along with the number of critical errors to assign an <a>adjectival</a> rating to the Functional Outcome. Testers will then use the guidance below along with reasonable judgement of the context that the errors occur in to assign an accessibility score of the Functional Outcome:</p>
					<div class="example">
						<p>Potential thresholds for adjectival ratings of test results (noting that the thresholds are different for different functional outcomes):</p>
					<dl>
					<dt>Very Poor (0)</dt>
					<dd>Any critical failures or less than 50% of related tests fail</dd>
					<dt>Poor (1)</dt>
					<dd>No critical failures, <abbr title="approximately">approx.</abbr> 50% to 79%</dd>
					<dt>Fair (2)</dt>
					<dd>No critical failures, approx. 80% to 89%</dd>
					<dt>Good  (3)</dt>
					<dd>No critical failures, approx. 90% to 98%</dd>
					<dt>Excellent (4)</dt>
					<dd>No critical failures, approx. 99% to 100%</dd>
				</dl>
				<p class="ednote">These cutoff points are still being tested and adjusted. These are included as examples to gather feedback on this scoring approach. </p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h4>Overall Scores</h4>
				<p>After all Functional Outcomes have been scored, the ratings are averaged for a total score and a score by the <a>functional category(ies)</a> they support. Conformance at the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> level requires no critical failures and at least 3.5 total score and at least a 3.5 score within each functional category. </p>
				
				<p class="ednote">This approach, which allows the tester some flexibility in assigning scores, has the advantage of simplicity and allowing a tester to take the context into account beyond the simple percentages. The second option we are exploring is to carry percentages from tests through to a final score. In this case a Bronze rating would require a total score of at least 90% and at least 90% within each functional need category. This number will likely shift as we continue testing.  We invite comment on these options as well as suggestions for an alternative solution. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h4>Scoring Holistic Tests</h4>			
				<p>The points from <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic tests</a> do not affect the scores of <a href="#traditional-tests">traditional tests</a>. Rather a minimum number of holistic tests will need to be met in order to reach a <a href="#silver">Silver</a> rating and additional holistic tests will be needed to reach a <a href="#gold">Gold</a> rating. Getting a Silver or Gold rating requires a bronze rating.</p>  
				<p class="ednote">We continue to work on the scoring of holistic tests and will provide more details in a future iteration of this document. </p>

			<h2>Conformance</h2>
			<p>Conformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the 'requirements' of the standard. In WCAG 3.0 the 'requirements' are the Functional Outcomes. </p>
			<p>Technology can meet the Functional Outcomes without a conformance claim.  If you want to claim conformance, you must follow the process below; however, even if you are not making a formal conformance claim, you can use this process to assess the accessibility of content.</p>

			<section>
				<h3>Conformance Levels</h3>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 defines three levels of conformance: <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a>, <a href="#silver">Silver</a>, and <a href="#gold">Gold</a>.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>Bronze</h4>
					<p>Bronze is the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the Bronze level does not conform to WCAG 3.0. The Bronze level can be verified using <a href="#traditional-tests">traditional tests</a>. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.x generally can conform to the Bronze level of WCAG 3.0, though WCAG 3-specific evaluation is still needed.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the Bronze level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The total score and score within each of the functional categories MUST be at least 3.5; and</li>
						<li><a>Views</a> and <a>processes</a> MUST NOT have <a>critical errors</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Silver</h4>
					<p>Silver is a higher conformance level that addresses additional functional outcomes. Some <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic testing</a> is necessary to verify conformance to this level.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the Silver level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All <a>views</a> MUST satisfy the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> criteria; and</li>
						<li>TBD of holistic tests</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Gold</h4>
					<p>Gold is the highest conformance level that addresses the remaining functional outcomes described in the guidelines. Additional <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic testing</a> is necessary to verify conformance to this level.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the Gold level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All <a>views</a> MUST satisfy the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> criteria; and</li>
						<li>TBD of holistic tests</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Defining Conformance Scope</h3>
				<p>Conformance is defined only for <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one process and view, a series of processes and views, or multiple related processes and views.  All unique steps in a process MUST be represented in the set of views. Views outside of the process MAY also be included in the scope.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The AG WG and Silver Task Force recognize that representative sampling is an important strategy that large and complex sites use to assess accessibility. While it is not addressed within this document at this time, our intent is to later address it within this document or in a separate document before the guidelines reach the Candidate Recommendation stage. We welcome your suggestions and feedback about the best way to incorporate representative sampling in WCAG 3.0.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance Requirements</h3>
				<p>In order for technology to <a>conform</a> to WCAG 3.0, the following conformance requirements apply:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Conformance Level</b> - Content MUST meet the requirements of the selected <a href="#conformance-levels">conformance level</a>.</li>
					<li><b>Processes and Views</b> - Conformance (and conformance level) MUST apply to complete <a>Processes</a> and <a>Views</a>, and MUST NOT exclude any part of a process or view.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance Claims</h3>
				<p>Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 3.0 without making a claim. The material below describes how to make a conformance claim if that option is chosen.</p>
				<section><h4>Required Components of a Conformance Claim</h4><p>A conformance claim MUST include the following information:</p><ol>
						<li><b>Date</b> of the claim</li>
						<li><b>Guidelines title, version and URI</b> "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 at ???"</li>
						<li><b>Conformance level</b> satisfied: (Bronze, Silver, or Gold)</li>
					</ol><b>A concise description of the views and processes</b>, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including any state changes which lead to a new view.</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Example Conformance Claim</h4>
					<p>On 12 August 2020, the following 10 views and 2 processes conform to WCAG 3.0 at a Bronze level. Processes were selected because they are the most common activities on the site and include 4 unique views. The other 6 views are additional commonly used pages.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Process 1: Order Newsletter (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, www.example.com/newsletter)</li>
						<li>Process 2: Comment on Blog Post (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a> (with comment model open)</li>

			<h2>Differences From WCAG 2</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Functional Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Functional Outcomes are different from WCAG 2.x Success Criteria. Compared to Success Criteria, Functional Outcomes are written to be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>in plain language; </li>
					<li> More understandable by people who are not experts in technology;</li>
					<li>More user-need oriented instead of technology oriented;</li>
					<li>More granular, so there will be more of them;</li>
					<li>More flexible to allow more tests than the true/false statements of WCAG 2.x. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The design of Functional Outcomes allows more varied needs of people with disabilities than could have been included in WCAG 2.x. </p>
				<p>Methods map approximately to WCAG 2.x Techniques documents.</p>
