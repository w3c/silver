			<p>The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 provide a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to users with disabilities. Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with blindness, low vision and other vision impairments; deafness and hearing loss; limited movement and dexterity; speech disabilities; sensory disorders; cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other web of things devices. They address various types of web content including static content, interactive content, visual and auditory media, and virtual and augmented reality. The guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>Each <a>guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a>outcomes</a> to determine whether the need has been met. Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a>methods</a> to meet each outcome. </p>
			<p>This specification is expected to be updated regularly to keep pace with changing technology by updating and adding methods, outcomes, and guidelines to address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several levels of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>

				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 show ways to make web content accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG 3.0 is a newer standard than the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2. You may use WCAG 2.2 or the new standard.</p>
				<p>What’s new in WCAG 3.0?</p>	 
				<ul>
				<li>WCAG 3.0 includes the needs of people with more types of disabilities.</li>
				<li>We received a lot of feedback from our first drafts.  We changed our approach to what is required to meet WCAG3.</li>
				<li>We removed old material that was not consistent with the new approach.  It does not mean we will not include it eventually, but to eliminate confusion, we have removed material that is no longer consistent with our current proposals. </li> 
				<li>We are not publishing an updated WCAG3 Explainer. </li>

				<h3>About WCAG 3.0</h3>
				<p>This specification presents a new model and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities. The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 support a wide set of user needs, use new approaches to testing, and allow frequent maintenance of guidelines and related content to keep pace with accelerating technology change. WCAG 3.0 supports this evolution by focusing on users’ functional needs. These needs are then supported by outcomes and technology-specific methods to meet those needs. </p>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions, but does not <a>deprecate</a> WCAG 2.X. It will also incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/"> User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/"> Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. These earlier versions provided a flexible model that kept them relevant for over 10 years. However, changing technology and changing needs of people with disabilities have led to the need for a new model to address content accessibility more comprehensively and flexibly.</p>
				<p>There are many differences between WCAG 2.X and WCAG 3.0. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 A &amp; AA is expected to meet most of the minimum conformance level of this new standard but, since WCAG 3.0 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics, additional work will be needed to reach full conformance. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.X, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and other approaches to facilitate migration.</p>

				<h3>Section status levels</h3>
				<p>As part of the WCAG 3.0 drafting process each normative section of this document is given a status. This status is used to indicate how far along in the development this section is, how ready it is for experimental adoption, and what kind of feedback the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is looking for.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong id="status-placeholder">Placeholder</strong>: This content is temporary, it showcases the type of content or section to expect here. All of this is expected to be replaced. No feedback is needed on placeholder content.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-exploratory">Exploratory</strong>: The working group is exploring what direction to take with this section. This content is not refined, details and definitions may be missing. Feedback should be about the proposed direction.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-developing">Developing</strong>: There is rough agreement on what is needed for this section, although not all high-level concerns have been settled. Details have been filled, but are yet to be worked out. Feedback should be focused on ensuring the sections are usable and reasonable in a broad sense.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-refining">Refining</strong>: The working group has reach consensus on this section. It is ready for broad public review and experimental adoption. Feedback should be focused on the feasibility and implementability.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-mature">Mature</strong>: Content is believed by the working group to be ready for recommendation. Feedback should be focused on edge case scenarios the working group may not have anticipated.</li>

				<h3>Relationship to other W3C guidelines</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> [[WCAG20]] were designed to be technology neutral, and have stayed relevant for over 10 years. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]] provide guidance for various types of software that assist people in writing accessible content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis.</p>
				<p>These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG 2.X, ATAG, and UAAG.</li>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 is not backward compatible with WCAG 2.0, ATAG 2.0, and UAAG 2.0.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Goals and Requirements</h3>
				<p>The goal of WCAG 3.0 and supporting documents is to make digital products including web, ePub, PDF, applications, mobile apps, and other emerging technologies more accessible and usable to people with disabilities. It is the intention for WCAG 3.0 to meet this goal by supporting a wider set of user needs, using new approaches to testing, and allowing more frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. The hope is that WCAG 3.0 will make it significantly easier for both beginners and experts to create accessible digital products that support the needs of people with disabilities.</p>

				<p>Research and design work performed by the Silver Task Force identified key requirements needed to improve upon the existing WCAG 2.X structure. These requirements, presented in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/">Requirements for WCAG 3.0</a> document, shaped the guidelines that follow and should be taken into account when evaluating and updating the guidelines.</p>
			</section>
			<p class="ednote"> While the majority of guidelines are still to be written and we continue to explore additional ways of validating conformance, we seek wider public review on the approach presented here. </p>

			<h2>Normative requirements</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>There are two types of content in this document:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Normative:</strong> what you must do to meet the guidelines.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-normative:</strong> advice to help you meet the guidelines. This is also called <q>Informative</q>.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			<p>In addition to this section, the <a href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a>, <a href="#testing">Testing</a>, and <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a> sections in WCAG 3.0 provide <a>normative</a> content and define requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as <q>non-normative</q>, diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>
			<p class="ednote">Outcomes are normative. The working group is looking for feedback on whether the following should be normative or informative: guidelines and methods.</p>

			<h2>Guidelines</h2>
				<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>The following guidelines are being considered for WCAG 3.0. They are currently a list of topics which we expect to explore more thoroughly in future drafts.  </p>
			</details>
		
			
			<div class="ednote">
			<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including functional categories of disabilities, general guidelines, outcomes that can be tested, a rich collection of methods, resource links, and code samples.</p>

			<p>The following guidelines are being considered for inclusion in WCAG 3.0. They are used to illustrate what WCAG 3.0 could look like, demonstrate the structure, and test the process of writing and testing content. <strong>These guideline drafts should not be considered as final content of WCAG 3.0</strong>.</p>

			<h2>Conformance</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>You might want to make a claim that your content or product meets the WCAG 3.0 outcomes. If it does meet the outcomes, we call this “conformance.” To conform to WCAG 3.0, your test results must show that your project is accessible.</p>
				<p>If you want to make a conformance claim, you must use the process described in this document. However, conformance claims are not required and your content can conform to WCAG 3.0, even if you don’t want to make a claim. You can still use this process to test your project’s accessibility.</p>	
			</details>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 will include a new conformance model in order to address a wider range of user needs, test a wider range of technologies and support new approaches to testing. There are several key goals for this new conformance model:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Develop a model that encourages websites to continue to improve accessibility (vs. stopping at the previous AA level);</li>
					<li>Better reflect the lived experience of people with disabilities, who successfully use sites that have some content that does not meet WCAG 2.0 AA, or who encounter barriers with sites that meet WCAG 2.0 AA;</li>
					<li>Allow for bugs and oversight by content authors, provided the impact of them upon users with disabilities is not substantial. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>We are exploring several approaches to conformance. After studying the comments on the previous draft, these are the concepts that showed promise.  We are giving an overview in this draft, but we continue to test the combination of the concepts.  </p>
				<p>These approaches can fit together in a variety of ways. We will be testing these approaches and others for <a>validity</a>, <a>reliability</a>, <a>sensitivity</a>, <a>adequacy</a>, <a>complexity</a> and <a>equity</a>. We welcome suggestions on ways to improve these approaches to better meet these criteria and concerns about how they might affect accessibility. The working group plans to select from or even replace these options in late 2023 based on feedback, prototyping, and testing. </p>
				<p>There are two main approaches to evaluating conformance that are promising.  There are also detailed ideas that support the main approaches. The two main approaches are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Outcomes and Tests</strong>:  Outcomes are verifiable statements that allow testers to reliably determine if the content being evaluated satisfies the user needs identified in the Guideline. Outcomes are addressed in Section 4.1. Tests are addressed in Section 4.2. </li>
					<li><strong>Assertions and Procedures:</strong> <em>Assertions</em> are attributable statements by a person or organization that they followed a <em>procedure</em> to improve accessibility. Assertions are addressed in Section 4.3. 
				</ul>
				<p>There are additional ideas that support these two approaches and can be used or combined in many different ways. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Conformance levels:</strong> Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels continue to receive positive feedback as an approach for overall conformance rating. </li>  
					<li><strong>Issue Severity:</strong>  Outcomes may allow for the concept of varying severity. High severity issues are those which prevent users from completing user processes (tasks). </li>
					<li><strong>Adjectival Ratings:</strong> Adjectival Ratings allow testers to grade a test, outcome, or guideline by an adjective rating (such as fail, pass, exemplary) or a numeric rating (such as 1-5) that potentially can be closer to the lived experience of a person with a disability. </li> 
					<li><strong>Pre-assessment conditions:</strong>  Pre-Assessment checks are tests or criteria that implementers can use to determine if they are ready to assess conformance.  The intent is to help organizations prepare for conformance testing, not to create a new level of conformance. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The details of these approaches change as we assemble them into a coherent whole.  This draft gives a high level overview of these approaches so we can give an update and receive feedback on the individual approaches we are considering.  </p> 

			<section data-status="developmental">
			<h3>Outcomes</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>To be written once content is agreed on. </p>
			</details>
			<div class="ednote">
			<p>To be written when we sort out the Outcome questions. </p>
			</div>
			<p>Outcomes are verifiable statements that allow testers to reliably determine if the content being evaluated satisfies the user needs identified in the Guideline. All Outcomes and Assertions that relate to a Guideline will be listed together to encourage adoption of higher levels of accessibility. </p>
			<p>Each outcome is associated with at least one <a>method</a>. Each method contains explanation, examples, resources, and <a>sets of tests</a>  for meeting the outcome. Methods can apply to a specific technology, such as HTML, or can be more generic where the advice applies no matter what technology, such as the methods supporting the Clear Language guideline. </p>

			<p>Outcomes are written so that testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies based solely on the outcome, even when methods do not yet exist for those technologies.</p>

			<h3>Tests</h3>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>What types of tests and scopes are used?</summary>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two (2) types of tests which are evaluated:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Quantifiable tests:</strong> Tests where results will not vary based on the tester or approach. Examples include testing whether certain properties exist in the content or if they match a value specified by the requirement.</li>

					<li><strong>Qualitative tests:</strong> Tests that rely on a qualitative evaluation based on existing criteria. Test results may vary between testers who understand the criteria. An example is evaluating the quality of a requirement such as alternative text.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Tests can be applied to four (4) different scopes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Item:</strong> A component or unit of content. Examples include a drop down menu, a media player, a phrase, or an image.</li>
					<li><strong>View:</strong> All content visually and programmatically available without a user-initiated substantive change.</li>
					<li><strong>User process:</strong> Series of user actions, and the distinct items and interactive views that support the actions, where each action is required in order to complete an activity.</li>
					<li><strong>Aggregate:</strong> Combination of all related items, user processes, and views.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p><strong>This editor note needs to be rewritten to reflect the new proposals.</strong></p>
				<p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
				<ul>

					<li>How well does the testing approach defined here support additional requirements not addressed in 2.2?</li>
					<li>How well does the testing approach defined here support regulatory needs?</li>
					<li>How will these tests be integrated into a conformance model (including levels or scores)?</li>
					<li>For multiple ways to measure, how will organizations declare which specification they are following in a way that is transparent, both to their users and for the purpose of verification in audits?</li>
					<li>As written, outcomes and assertions are at the same level. Would moving assertions to the test level be more effective?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Next steps include:</p>
				<ul>	
					<li>Get feedback from designers, developers, and other communities on wording choice.</li>
					<li>Finalize names and descriptions of scope and tests,</li>				
					<li>Develop detailed examples of methods and test,</li>
					<li>Test the accuracy, reliability, repeatability, etc. of this approach,</li>
					<li>Address all github issues under <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/milestone/16" target="_blank">test types and terminology milestone</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<section>
				<h4>Types of tests</h4>
					<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two (2) types of tests which are evaluated:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Quantifiable tests:</strong> Tests where results will not vary based on the tester or approach. Examples include testing whether certain properties exist in the content or if they match a value specified by the requirement.</li>

					<li><strong>Qualitative tests:</strong> Tests that rely on a qualitative evaluation based on existing criteria. Test results may vary between testers who understand the criteria. One example is evaluating the quality of alternative text used to meet a requirement for alternative text.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Most tests have prescribed ways to meet the test. In some cases, the ways to meet the test will change based on a specific condition being met (example: the language the content is written in).</p>

				<p>Although content may satisfy all outcomes using quantifiable and qualitative tests, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. The assertions (see section 4.3 below) are designed to address this problem. </p>

				<section>
					<h5>Quantifiable tests</h5>
					<p>Quantifiable tests rely on measuring properties of the content based on nominal values. The test results are objectively verifiable, to avoid variation of test results between different testers. Values are quantifiable, and could be boolean (true/false), for example to check the presence of titles, text alternatives, and accessible names. Other values could include numerical thresholds; for example, to check color luminosity ratios.</p>
					<p>Each method using quantifiable tests includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the values being tested; and</li>
						<li>an algorithm to measure the properties of the content based on the values.</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="example">
						<h6>Example quantifiable test</h6>
						<p>These tests are already part of WCAG 2.x.</p>
						<p>Example for 1.1.1: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/23a2a8/" target="_blank">Image has non-empty accessible name</a></p>
						<p>Example for 1.4.3: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/afw4f7/proposed/" target="_blank">Text has minimum contrast</a></p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h5>Qualitative tests</h5>
					<p>Qualitative tests rely on evaluating content based on a set of defined expectations and exceptions. The set of expectations and exceptions limit the scope of decisions, to minimize variation of test results arrived at by different testers. Still, some level of qualitative assessment is required, therefore the accuracy of the test results also depends on the knowledge and context of the testers to some degree.</p>
					<p>Each method using qualitative tests includes:</p> 
					<ul>
						<li>the defined expectations being tested; and</li>
						<li>guidance on evaluating how well the content meets the defined expectations.</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="example">
						<p=h6>Example qualitative test</h6>
						<p>These tests are already part of WCAG 2.x.</p>
						<p>Example for 1.1.1: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/qt1vmo/proposed/" target="_blank">Image accessible name is descriptive </a></p>
						<p>Example for 2.4.6: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/cc0f0a/proposed/" target="_blank">Form Field Label is Descriptive</a></p>

				<h4>Conditions</h4>
				<p>Some tests only apply in certain situations. Testing may occasionally require determining and referencing which specifications are being tested against.  Methods will note whether a test always applies or under what conditions a test applies. Both Quantitative and Qualitative tests can be conditional. </p>

				<h3>Assertions</h3>
				<p>An Assertion is a formal claim of fact, attributed to a person or organization. In WCAG 3, an assertion is an attributable and documented statement of fact regarding procedures practiced in the development and maintenance of the content or product to improve accessibility. Testing of an assertion is always true/false &mdash; did they make an assertion and provide the required documentation?</p>

				<p>WCAG 3 recommends supporting documentation that an organization can use to improve or validate procedures and assertions. Conforming does not require this supporting documentation be made public.</p>
				</section>

			<section data-status="developmental">				
				<h4>Using Assertions</h4>
				<p>Assertions may supplement methods in one or more outcomes. Assertions should only be used on outcomes and guidelines that allow assertions. Organizations can make an assertion that they followed a procedure to claim conformance.</p>

				<p>Procedures used in assertions may be implemented at the organization level, during design and development, or during testing</p>

				<p>Examples of procedures that may be used during implementation might include:</p>
					<ul><li>Training</li>
					<li>FTE (Full Time Equivalent) assignments</li>
					<li>Skills testing</li>
					<li>Coordination and documentation of accessibility processes</li>
					<li>Setting the priority for remediation</li></ul> 

				<p>Examples of procedures that may be used to evaluate accessibility might include:</p>
					<ul><li>Usability testing</li>
					<li>Heuristic evaluation</li>
					<li>Assistive technology testing</li></ul>
				<div class="ednote">
					<p>The AGWG is considering what will qualify as a procedure in WCAG 3. A procedure may be limited to guidance:
						<ul><li>approved by AGWG and listed in WCAG,</li>
						<li>that references publicly published guidance, or</li>
						<li>that meets criteria specified in WCAG</li></ul>
					or it may be any process that an organization uses to improve accessibility.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section data-status="developmental">			
				<h4>Documenting Assertions</h4>

					<p>Assertions must be documented as part of the conformance claim process.  The required information may also be made available through the web site.</p> 

					<p>Assertions might include the following information:</p>
						<ul><li>The statement being asserted</li>
						<li>The date of the assertion</li>
						<li>The date or date range the procedure was completed</li>
						<li>The scope of the assertion</li>
						<li>Contact information for the person or group making the assertion</li>
						<li>The outcome(s) or guideline(s) supported by the assertion</li></ul>

				<p class="ednote">An alternative to specifying assertions at the outcome or guideline level might be to require the assertion apply to the scope of the conformance claim.</p>
			</section>

			<section data-status="developmental">			
				<h4>Supporting Documentation for Assertions</h4>
				<p>WCAG recommends maintaining additional information that can support procedures. WCAG  will not require organizations to provide supporting documentation to conform.</p>

				<p class="ednote">The AGWG will add to this section as other areas are confirmed.</p>
			</section>

			<section data-status="developmental">			
				<h4>Testing Assertions</h4>
				<p>The quality of an assertion can be tested based on how well the assertion meets the documentation requirements for assertions (See <a href="#documenting-assertions">Documenting Assertions</a>). Conforming to WCAG does not require testing supporting documentation; however, organizations may decide to adopt additional documentation requirements based on the procedure being asserted. </p>

				<h3>Conformance levels</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
					<p>This section is exploratory. We are exploring several approaches to conformance. These approaches can fit together in a variety of ways. We will be testing these approaches and others for validity, reliability, sensitivity, adequacy, complexity and equity. We welcome suggestions on ways to improve them to better meet these criteria and concerns about how they might affect accessibility. The working group plans to select from or even replace these options in late 2023 based on feedback, prototyping, and testing.</p>
					<p>While there is a lot of overlap between WCAG 2 and WCAG 3, WCAG 3 will include additional tests and different scoring mechanics. As a result, WCAG 3.0 is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.X.</p>


					<p>The percentages used are placeholders and will need to be determined through testing. As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:
						<ul><li>Which option has the best chance of adoption and why?</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Next steps include</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Further refine options</li>
							<li>Test the accuracy, reliability, repeatability, etc. of each option</li>
							<li>Write sample guidelines to test out each option</li>
						</ul></p>
				</div>

				<p>WCAG 3.0 defines three levels of conformance: bronze, silver, and gold. While it is easy to replicate the WCAG2 A, AA, AAA by renaming the levels, there is an opportunity to improve accessibility for people with disabilities by using a more advanced approach.  </p>
				<p><strong>Bronze</strong> is the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the bronze level does not conform to WCAG 3.0. In order to reach Bronze level, the scope claimed in the conformance statement must pass a subset of Outcomes and Assertions. The subset will require enough Outcomes and Assertions to improve equity across functional needs.</p>

				<p><strong>Silver</strong> level incentivizes organizations to go further to improve accessibility. One possibility that we are examining is that Silver level points can accumulate even prior to completing bronze but are not usable until Bronze is achieved. The goal is to encourage organizations to go beyond the minimum, especially where organizations want to be recognized for their efforts to go beyond minimum accessibility. </p>
				
				<p><strong>Gold</strong> level identifies measures we want to include for those organizations that do achieve Silver so that some can stand out as exemplary, cutting edge, and role models. There are a number of ideas that will be developed further once more of the conformance structure is solidified. </p>

				<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Issue Severity</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
				<p>This section is exploratory. </p>
				<p>Severity rating could contribute towards scoring and prioritization. </p> 
						<p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Is every issue critical to someone, making this concept invalid?</li>
							<li>How best to assign severity, particularly if testers have different ideas on what is critical?</li>
							<li>How do we incorporate context/process/task? Is that part of scoping, or issue severity? Both are important to the end result.</li>
							<li>What to do with non-critical issues?</li>
							<li>If included, how will situations where severity depends on context be handled?</li>
							<li>Can the matrix inform designation of functional categories? For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2021/outcomes/text-alternative-available">Text Alternative Available outcome</a>.</li>
							<li>How will issue severity fit into levels? For example:<ul>
									<li>"Bronze" could be an absence of any critical or high issues;</li>
									<li>"Silver" could be an absence of any critical, high, or medium issues.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>How to account for cumulative issues becoming critical?</li>
							<li>Would another approach be more effective, for example assigning critical issues after testing is complete based on task or type of task rather than by test.</li>
						</ol>
				<p>Next steps include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Testing the assumption that some failures cause a greater impact to users than others.</li>
					<li>Explore whether the concept of issue severity can be applied consistently and effectively. </li>
				</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Outcomes may allow for the concept of varying severity. High severity issues are those which prevent users from completing user processes (tasks). </p>
				<p>Tests could include critical issues. Each test could have a category of severity, so some tests will be flagged as causing a critical issue.  Examples of critical issues in tests are at <a href="https://raw.githack.com/w3c/silver/Editor-draft-cleanup/methods/functional-images/tests.html">Text Alternative Available</a> and <a href="https://raw.githack.com/w3c/silver/Editor-draft-cleanup/methods/text-equiv/tests.html">Translates Speech And Non-Speech Audio</a>.</p>

				<h3>Adjectival Ratings</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
				<p>This section is exploratory. </p>
				</div>
				<p><a>Adjectival Ratings</a> allow test results to go beyond Pass or Fail to show progress towards a goal or exceeding a goal. Example of Possible adjectival ratings are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fail, Pass, Exceptional</li>
					<li>Fail, Progress, Pass, Better, Exceptional</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Outcomes or Guidelines could be evaluated using adjectival ratings:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This includes both directly Testable outcomes and Qualitative measures that are asserted. </li>
					<li>Outcomes might be assigned an adjectival rating based on methods used to meet the outcome and issue severity</li>
					<li>Guidelines might be assigned an adjectival rating based on the outcomes and assertions completed under the guideline. </li>
				</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Percentages</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
				<p>This section is exploratory. </p>
				<p>We are exploring whether percentages could apply to Bronze but have not found a model to date where this works without adding complexity and time needed for testing. </p>
				<p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How can percentages be used in a way that is equitable across disabilities? </li>
				</ul>
				</div>
				<p>In this approach, percentage of Outcomes and Assertions passed or percentage passed at a certain adjectival rating might be used to conform to Silver and Gold levels. </p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Pre-Assessment Checks</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
				<p>This section is exploratory. </p>
				</div>
				<p>Pre-Assessment checks are tests or criteria that implementors can use to determine if they are ready to assess conformance.  The intent of specifying these would be to help implementors prepare for conformance testing, not to create a new level of conformance. Examples of pre-assessment checks might be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The video player used has the ability to display captions and support multiple audio tracks</li>
					<li>All non-text elements on a page have an accessible name</li>
				</section>				
			</section>					

			<section data-status="exploratory">
			<h3>User generated content</h3>
			<p>Web content publishers may include content provided by the users of their digital products. We refer to such content as "<a href="#user-generated-content">User Generated Content</a>".</p>
			<p>Examples of User Generated Content include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>social media postings and comments,</li>
					<li>uploaded photographs, or</li>
					<li>uploaded videos or other multimedia.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>User Generated Content is provided for publication by visitors where the content platform specifically welcomes and encourages it. User-generated content is content that is submitted through a user interface designed specifically for members of the public and customers. Use of the same user interface as an authoring tool for publication of content by agents of the publisher (such as employees, contractors, or authorized volunteers) acting on behalf of the publisher does not make that content User Generated Content. The purpose of the User Generated Content Conformance is to allow WCAG 3 outcomes and methods to require additional or different steps to improve the accessibility of User Generated Content.</p>
			<p>An important part of WCAG Conformance is the specific guidance that is associated with individual WCAG 3 guidelines and outcomes. Not all WCAG 3 guidelines will have unique outcomes and testing for User Generated Content. Unless User Generated Content requirements are specified in a particular guideline, that guideline applies as written whether or not the content is User Generated. </p>
			
			<p class="ednote">We plan for a future Working Draft to include specific examples of guidelines with additional requirements for user generated content.  One example would be 'alternative text'. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) has specific guidance for providing a mechanism for alternative text. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b23">ATAG  2.0 Guideline B.2.3</a> - "Assist authors with managing alternative content for non-text content" could be adapted to provide specific, guideline-related guidance for user generated alternative text. </p>
			
			<p>The web content publisher should identify all locations of User Generated Content (such as commentary on hosted content, product descriptions for consumer to consumer for sale listings, and restaurant reviews) and perform standard accessibility evaluation analysis for each. If there are no accessibility issues, the User Generated Content is fully conforming.</p>
			<section>
			<h4>Steps to conform</h4>
			<p>If accessibility issues are identified, or if the website author wants to proactively address potential accessibility issues that might arise from User Generated Content, then all of the following must be indicated alongside the User Generated Content or in an Accessibility Statement published on the site or product that is linked from the view or page in a consistent location:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Clearly identify where User Generated Content can be found on the publisher's digital product (perhaps by id href);</li>
				<li>Clearly identify the steps taken to encourage accessibility in User Generated Content such as prompting the user for ALT text for their uploaded images before they are accepted and the disallowal of text attributes except as they are part of semantic markup such as strong, headings, etc., as enumerated in Guideline Outcomes;</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="ednote">Editor's Note: Once the conformance approach is included, content that passes all tests will be considered fully conformant. It remains to be determined how to address User Generated Content that has accessibility issues; and to define what minimum thresholds might be acceptable. We expect WCAG 3 to provide this guidance within individual guidelines and outcomes and to support testing for conformance. The working group is looking at alternative requirements to apply to User Generated Content guideline by guideline, and is seeking feedback on what would serve as reasonable requirements on how to best support accessibility in User Generated Content with known (or anticipated) accessibility issues. The working group intends to more thoroughly address the contents and the location of an accessibility statement in a future draft.</p>

				<h3>Conforming alternative version</h3>
				<p class="ednote">For this first draft, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has focused on the basic conformance model. For a next draft, we will explore how <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternative versions</a> fit into the new conformance model.</p>

				<h3>Only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies</h3>
				<p class="ednote">For this first draft, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has focused on the basic conformance model. For a next draft, we will explore how <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc4">accessibility-supported</a> fits into the new conformance model.</p>
			</section>
			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Defining conformance scope</h3>
				<p>When evaluating the accessibility of content, WCAG 3.0 requires the outcomes apply to a specific scope. While the scope can be an all content within a digital product, it is usually one or more sub-sets of the whole. Reasons for this include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Large amounts of content are impractical to evaluate comprehensively using anything beyond <a>automated evaluation</a> of atomic tests;</li>
					<li>In many cases, content changes frequently, causing evaluation to be accurate only for a specific moment in time;</li>
					<li>Some content is more important to the majority of users than other content; and</li>
					<li>Content that mostly meets the requirements but has problems can interfere with the user's ability to complete a process.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 therefore defines two ways to scope content: <a>views</a> and <a>processes</a>. Evaluation is done on one or more complete views or processes, and conformance is determined on the basis of one or more complete views or processes. </p>

				<p>Conformance is defined only for <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one process and view, a series of processes and views, or multiple related processes and views. All unique steps in a process MUST be represented in the set of views. Views outside of the process MAY also be included in the scope.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The AG WG and Silver Task Force recognize that representative sampling is an important strategy that large and complex sites use to assess accessibility. While it is not addressed within this document at this time, our intent is to later address it within this document or in a separate document before the guidelines reach the Candidate Recommendation stage. We welcome your suggestions and feedback about the best way to incorporate representative sampling in WCAG 3.0.</p>

				<h3>Conformance requirements</h3>
				<p>In order for technology to <a>conform</a> to WCAG 3.0, the following conformance requirements apply:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Conformance level</b> - Content MUST meet the requirements of the selected <a href="#conformance-levels">conformance level</a>.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Conformance claims</h3>
				<p>Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 3.0 without making a claim. The material below describes how to make a conformance claim if that option is chosen.</p>
				<section><h4>Required components of a conformance claim</h4><p>A conformance claim MUST include the following information:</p><ol>
						<li><b>Date</b> of the claim;</li>
						<li><b>Guidelines title, version and URI</b>
							<q>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 at ???</q></li>
						<li><b>Conformance level</b> satisfied: (bronze, silver, or gold);</li>
						<li><b>A concise description of the views and processes</b>, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including any state changes which lead to a new view; and</li>
						<li>The technology including the hardware, software, and assistive technology used to test the claim.</li>
						</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Example conformance claim</h4>
					<p>On 12 August 2020, the following 10 views and 2 processes conform to WCAG 3.0 at a bronze level. Processes were selected because they are the most common activities on the site and include 4 unique views. The other 6 views are the most commonly used.</p>

					<p>The reproducibility and consistency of scores i.e. the extent to which they are the same when evaluations of the same resources are carried out in different contexts (different tools, different people, different goals, different time). This would be particularly useful to ensure that similar results are achieved by different testers. It would also be useful to see if different testers would select the same path or off-path decisions. Representative sampling tests also fit in this category.

This metric is useful for determining if the conformance proposal captures the impact of the severity of accessibility barriers on the final score and if different disabilities are treated equally by the proposal.  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/wiki/index.php?title=Benchmarking_Web_Accessibility_Metrics">Benchmarking Web Accessibility Metrics</a>, Vigo, Lopes, O Connor, Brajnik, Yesilada 2011. </p>

				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Outcomes are different from WCAG 2.X success criteria. Compared to success criteria, outcomes are written to be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In plain language; </li>
					<li>More understandable by people who are not experts in technology;</li>
					<li>More user-need oriented instead of technology oriented;</li>
					<li>More granular, so there will be more of them; and</li>
					<li>More flexible to allow more tests than the true/false statements of WCAG 2.X. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The design of outcomes allows more varied needs of people with disabilities than could have been included in WCAG 2.X. </p>
				<p>Methods map approximately to WCAG 2.X Techniques documents.</p>
