			<p>The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 provide a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible to users with disabilities. Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with blindness, low vision and other vision impairments; deafness and hearing loss; limited movement and dexterity; speech disabilities; sensory disorders; cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other Web of Things devices. They address various types of web content including static content, interactive content, visual and auditory media, and virtual and augmented reality. The guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>Each <a href="#guidelines">guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a href="#outcomes">outcomes</a> to measure if the need has been met. Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a href="#methods">methods</a> to meet each outcome. This specification is expected to be updated regularly to keep pace with changing technology by updating or adding methods, outcomes, and guidelines to address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several grades of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>
			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions, but does not <a>deprecate</a> these versions. They will  incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. 
			While there is a lot of overlap between WCAG 2.X and WCAG 3.0, WCAG 3.0 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics. As a result, WCAG 3.0 is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.X. WCAG 3.0 does not supersede WCAG 2.2 and previous versions; rather, it is an alternative and more modern set of guidelines. Once these guidelines become a W3C Recommendation, the W3C will advise developers, content creators and policy makers to use WCAG 3.0 in order to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. However, content that conforms to earlier versions of WCAG continue to conform to those versions.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 specify ways to make Web content accessible to users with disabilities. WCAG 3.0 is a newer standard than the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2. WCAG 2.2 will still be a valid standard to use.</p>
				<section>
				<h4>What’s new in WCAG 3.0?</h4>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 speaks to a wider range of people with disabilities. It covers the design of Web content and applications across a variety of platforms for both existing and emerging technology. It presents new methods for making content accessible and new tests for validating accessibility.</p>
				<p>The WCAG 3.0 guidelines form an up-to-date standard for addressing the diverse needs of people with disabilities. The Silver Task Force and its research partners integrated recent ideas about what works. Importantly, WCAG 3.0 has a new model for conforming to the standard.</p>
				<p>Some organizations may wish to use the previous guidelines. Others may wish to migrate to the new standard.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<h4>Who benefits from the guidelines?</h4>
				<p>While the guidelines focus on preventing barriers for people with disabilities, following the guidelines will improve the experience of <em>all</em> who use the content, not only people with disabilities.</p>

			<h3>About WCAG 3.0</h3>
			<p>This specification presents a new model and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities. The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 support a wide set of user needs, use new approaches to testing, and allow frequent maintenance of guidelines and related content to keep pace with accelerating technology change. WCAG 3.0 continues this evolution by focusing on users’ functional needs. These needs are then supported by outcomes and technology-specific methods to meet those needs. </p>
			<p>Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities. This includes accommodations for blindness, low vision and other vision impairments; deafness and hearing loss; limited movement and dexterity; speech disabilities; sensory disorders; cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make content more usable to users in general as well as accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
			<p>WCAG 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions, but does not <a>deprecate</a> WCAG 2.X. It will also incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/"> User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/"> Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. These earlier versions provided a flexible model that kept them relevant for over 10 years. However, changing technology and changing needs of people with disabilities have led to the need for a new model to address content accessibility more comprehensively and flexibly.</p>
			<p>There are many differences between WCAG 2.X and WCAG 3.0. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 A &amp; AA is expected to meet most of the minimum conformance level of this new standard but, since WCAG 3.0 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics, additional work will be needed to reach full conformance. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.X, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and other approaches to facilitate migration.</p>
			<p class="ednote">Future upates of the FPWD will include examples of ATAG and UTAG related content.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h3>Background on WCAG 3.0</h3>
				<p>The Silver Community Group and their research partners conducted a year of research which included a literature review as well as interviews, surveys, and self-reporting with people with disabilities, content developers, quality assurance professionals, tool developers, designers and policy makers.</p>
				<p>The results are available in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1POs7orJ4ALB0bq5_vyo4v8RxDcr-5ctwD1noVgpXuJc/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0">The Research Summary Slide Deck</a>. One recurring theme was positive perceptions about the popularity and quality of the guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were changes in the structure and presentation of accessibility guidance to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>improve usability — especially for beginners;</li>
					<li>support disability needs that cannot be tested by true/false success criteria; and</li>
					<li>facilitate maintenance to keep the guidelines more current.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The goal of WCAG 3.0 is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products on a variety of platforms. WCAG 3.0 uses a model that allows it to address more disability needs than WCAG 2.X, as well as address publishing requirements and emerging technologies such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It will also provide non-<a>normative</a> information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. The WCAG 3.0 model is designed to support better coverage across disabilities and be easier to maintain, so that the new model will be more enduring over time as technologies evolve.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Relationship to other W3C guidelines</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> [[WCAG20]] were designed to be technology neutral, and have stayed relevant for over 10 years. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]] provide guidance for various types of software that assist people in writing accessible content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis.</p>
				<p>These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG 2.X, ATAG, and UAAG.</li>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 is not backward compatible with WCAG 2.0, ATAG 2.0, and UAAG 2.0.</li>
				</ul>

			<section>
				<h3>Goals and Requirements</h3>
				<p>The goal of WCAG 3.0 and supporting documents is to make digital products including web, ePub, PDF, applications, mobile apps, and other emerging technologies more accessible and usable to people with disabilities. It is the intention for WCAG 3.0 to meet this goal by supporting a wider set of user needs, using new approaches to testing, and allowing more frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. The hope is that WCAG 3.0 will make it significantly easier for both beginners and experts to create accessible digital products that better reflect the lived experience of users with disabilities.</p>

				<p>Research and design work performed by the Silver Task Force identified key requirements needed to improve upon the existing WCAG 2.X structure. These requirements, presented in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/">Requirements for Silver</a> document, shaped the conformance proposal that follows and should be taken into account when evaluating and updating this proposal.</p>
			</section>
			<p class="ednote"> While the majority of guidelines are still to be written and we continue to explore additional ways of validating conformance, we seek wider public review on the approach presented here. </p>

			<h2>Structure of these guidelines</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 focuses on the diverse needs of people to use digital content. Each guideline helps reduce the barriers that <q>dis-able</q> people.</p>
				<p>The guidelines highlight users’ functional needs, such as the need for contrast. We elaborate on the advice by specifying practices that reduce barriers. The results of using these practices can be tested. We offer a variety of tests to rate how well user needs have actually been met.</p>
				<section>
				<h4>How is the advice organized?</h4>
				<p>To help make the advice usable, we structured it in layers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Functional needs</strong>: a way to express the condition that people encounter.</li>
					<li><strong>Functional categories</strong>: high level groupings of disabilities to aid in testing and remediating technology. Similar to functional performance criteria in Section 508 and functional performance statements in EN 301 549.</li>
					<li><strong>Guidelines</strong>: related solutions to functional needs that cross technologies and functional categories</li>
					<li><strong>How-to information:</strong> plain language advice by guideline on adapting content to meet users’ functional needs including information on getting started and how guidelines apply across technologies.</li>
					<li><strong>Outcomes</strong>: the desired result (or outcome) of practices that reduce barriers and support ease of use in the designed context</li>
					<li><strong>Methods</strong>: detailed techniques and tests for rating how well an outcome for a technology has been met</li>
					<li><b>Tags</b>: searchable concepts to improve findability and usability</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Not all of these layers are directly in this document. Some are pieces linked from here.</p>

				<figcaption>Core Structure</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a href="#guidelines-structure-diagram">Figure 1</a> shows <span id="guidelines-structure-description">the core structure of WCAG 3.0. WCAG 3.0 has three levels of content with associated documentation. Guidelines form the top level. Each guideline contains multiple outcomes. Each outcome contains mulitple methods.</span></p>
			<section>
				<h3>Guidelines</h3>
				<p>Guidelines provide a high-level, plain-language version of the content for managers, policy makers, individuals who are new to accessibility, and other individuals who need to understand the concepts but not dive into the technical details. They provide an easy-to-understand way of organizing and presenting the outcomes so that non-experts can learn about and understand the concepts. Guidelines include a unique, descriptive name along with high level plain language summaries that address functional needs on specific topics, such as contrast, forms, readability, and more. Guidelines group related outcomes and are technology-independent.</p>				
				<p class="example">Example: Use sections, headings, and sub-headings to organize your content.</p>			
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Each guideline contains multiple outcomes. Outcomes result from practices that reduce or eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience. Outcomes form the basis of a flexible and expansive architecture for accessibility guidelines that closely relates to the needs of people with disabilities. Outcomes are designed for use by developers, testers, and other technical experts. 
				</p>
				<p> Scoring is done at the outcome level. The scoring model is designed to be flexible in order to allow more functional needs of people with disabilities to be included in the guidelines. Outcomes are written as testable criteria and include information on how to score the outcome in an optional <a href="#conformance-claims">Conformance Claim</a>. Within a guideline, outcomes have an AND relationship. All relevant outcomes must be addressed but not all outcomes will apply to all technologies and sitations. When an outcome does not apply, it is marked NA in the scoring.</p>

				<p>Outcomes are <a>normative</a>. They are located in the normative section of specific guidelines.</p>
				<p class="example">Example: Convey hierarchy with semantic structure</p>
				<section>
					<h4>Critical errors</h4>
				</section> 
				<section>
					<h4>Scoring</h4>
				</section> 
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Key support resources</h3>
				<section>
					<h3>How-to information</h3>
					<p>The <a>How-To</a> content provides explanatory material for each guideline that applies across technologies. This guidance explains how to apply the concepts presented in the guidelines for non-technical readers. This plain language resource includes information on getting started, who the guideline helps and how, as well information for project managers, designers and developers.  </p>

						<img width="608" height="267" src="img/StructuredContent_How-To.png" />
							<figcaption>Example screenshot of a How-To for Structured Content</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p id="howTo_screenshot_description">The example of a How-To for Structured Content provides basic information organized by tabs to help people get started with accessibility for structured content, plan for implementing accessible structured content across a project, design accessible structured content, and basics for developers new to accessibility of structured content. It also includes information on examples, the outcomes for meeting the guideline, and resources.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Methods</h3>
					<figure id="method_screenshot" aria-labelledby="method_screenshot_description">
						<img width="300"  src="img/MethodHeadingsHTML2.png" />
							<figcaption>Screenshot of a Method for Structured Content</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Each outcome has one or more <a href="#methods">methods</a>. There are three types of methods:</p>
					<ul>					
						<li><strong>All</strong> - Methods that apply across all technologies. </li>
						<li><strong>Technology specific</strong> - Methods that apply to one of a predetermined list of technologies such as HTML, PDF, or VR. </li>
						<li><strong>Fallback</strong> - Methods that apply to emerging or proprietary technology and for technology that does not yest have a method written</li>
					</ul>
					<p>When technology specific methods are provided, the outcomes will also include one or more fallback methods.</p>
					
					<p id="method_screenshot_description">The methods include detailed information on how to meet the outcome, code samples, working examples, resources, as well as information about testing and scoring the method.</p>
					
					<p class="example">Example: Semantic headings (HTML)</p>
					
					<section>
						<h4>Description</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Examples</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Tests</h4>
						<p>Tests provide ways to check that methods and techniques have been followed. Tests include step-by-step instructions on evaluating the method based on the technology being used. Tests may vary by technology as needed.</p>
						<p> Tests specify the unit being tested and the approach to scoring for that test. Scoring can be binary (pass/fail) scoring or rating scales as appropriate for the outcome and technology. Binary scoring works well when the unit being tested has clear boundaries and pass/fail conditions.  Rating scales work better when the unit being tested does not have clear boundaries, when evaluating success requires a quality judgement, or when the test includes gradations of quality. </p>	
						
						<p>Each method includes information on how to score individual instances of the test. The testing results for methods inform the scoring of the related outcome.</p>
						<p class="note">While WCAG 3 Methods have some similarity with WCAG 2 Techniques, they are not the same and are not interchangeable.</p>

				</section>
			</section>

<section>
	<h4>Additional Documentation and Scoring Information</h4>
		<p>The core structure has interelationships with supporting documents and the scoring process. <span id="guidelines--full-structure-description"> Functional needs inform both outcomes and functional categories. The tests within Methods are used to inform the scores for each Outcome. Then outcome scores are are aggregated to create scores by functional category and an overall score. These then result in a bronze rating.  Silver and gold ratings build on the bronze rating to demonstrate improved accessibility. General information about guidelines is available in How To documents. </span></p>

			<section>
				<h3>Functional needs</h3>
				<p>The development of WCAG 3 guidelines starts with <a>functional needs</a>. A functional need is a statement that describes a specific gap in one’s ability, or a specific mismatch between ability and the designed environment or context. Functional needs are applied to specific topics (for example: contrast, forms, readability, and more)  to identify the barriers experienced by people with disabilities. The barriers in these topics inform the <a href="#outcomes">outcomes</a>, which state the conditions to test whether the functional needs have been met. Functional needs are documented in the how-tos, supplementary material accompanying the guidelines.</p>
				<p class="example">Example: Use without vision.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The work of cataloging functional needs is still in process and will continue after the First Public Working Draft.  Those interested can see more information in this draft Google document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJkgXqbh7dx3uD6XAy8XAANmwfbbVZ5GKb_gbsUdkVs/">Functional Needs - Expanded</a></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Functional categories</h3>
				<p>Functional categories of disabilities group the functional needs of users with disabilities. Functional categories are used when reporting test results in the optional conformance claim.</p>
				<p>Functional categories are similar to functional performance criterial in <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/draft-rule-2011/chapter-3-functional-performance-criteria">Section 508</a> and functional performance statements in <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101500_101599/101550/01.01.01_60/tr_101550v010101p.pdf">en 301 549</a>. The current list of functional cateogories is: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Vision and Visual</li>
					<li>Hearing and Auditory</li>
					<li>Sensory Intersections</li>
					<li>Mobility </li>
					<li>Motor</li>
					<li>Physical and Sensory Intersections</li>
					<li>Speech</li>
					<li>Attention</li>
					<li>Language and Literacy</li>
					<li>Learning</li>
					<li>Memory</li>
					<li>Executive</li>
					<li>Mental Health</li>
					<li>Cognitive and Sensory Intersections</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="ednote">The list of functional categories is a draft.  Creating meaningul groupings is still a work in progress and currently evolving along with the work on cataloging functional needs. This work will continue after the First Public Working Draft.  Those interested can see more information in this draft Google document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJkgXqbh7dx3uD6XAy8XAANmwfbbVZ5GKb_gbsUdkVs/">Functional Needs - Expanded</a></p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Conformance Levels</h3>
				<p>WCAG 3 has an optional scoring system that can better inform organizations on the quality of their accessibility effort. The optional conformance levels provide a way for organizations to report their conformance in simple manner. The bronze level is based on the score in each functional category and the overall score. Silver and gold levels require conforming at the bronze level plus additional improved usability for people with disabilities.</p>
				<p class="ednote">This first draft focuses on bronze level. Future drafts will have more information on silver and gold levels. We expect that bronze will be similar to WCAG 2 AA, while silver and gold will include more usability-type testing. This is still under development. WCAG 2.X AAA success criteria are generally included in WCAG 3. The design of the scoring model awards more points for implementing the outcomes that come from WCAG 2.X AAA.</p>

			<h2>Normative requirements</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 details the needs of people with disabilities and suggests how to test for what works. You may want to make formal claims about how well the results of your testing conform to the standard set out by the guidelines.</p>
				<p>If you do, notice there are two types of content signaled in this document:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Normative</strong>. Refers to requirements that impact the accessibility of content. Normative requirements specify what conforming to the standard means.</li>
					<li><strong>Non-normative</strong>. Refers to parts of this document that do not impact conforming to the standard. This advisory content is never required. Non-normative content includes overviews, appendices, diagrams, and examples. It is also called <q>Informative</q>.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			<p>The main content of WCAG 3.0 is <a>normative</a> and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as <q>non-normative</q>, diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>

			<h2>Guidelines</h2>

			<p class="ednote">These are <strong>early drafts of guidelines included to serve as examples</strong>. They are used to illustrate what WCAG 3.0 could look like and to test the process of writing content. These guideline drafts should not be considered as final content of WCAG 3.0. They are included to show how the structure would work. As this draft matures, numbering of individual guidelines will be removed to improve overall usability of the guidelines in response to public requests. </p>

			<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include Web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including functional categories of disabilities, general guidelines, outcomes that can be tested, a rich collection of methods, and documented common failures with examples, resource links, and code.</p>

			<p class="ednote">The process of migrating information from WCAG 2.X to WCAG 3.0 has just begun. This document presents initial examples of how the structure works. The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/guidelines/explainers/template.html">template for the new content</a> @@NEED NEW LINK TO TEMPLATE@@ presents the skeleton of the architecture and may help.

				<h3>Visual contrast of text</h3>
				<p class="guideline-text">Provide sufficient contrast between foreground text and its background.</p>
				<div class="ednote">
					<p>Visual Contrast is a migration from WCAG 2.1 with significant updates:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>New calculations of contrast based on more modern research on color perception.</li>
						<li>Merging the 1.4.3 AA and 1.4.6 AAA levels into one guideline.</li>
						<li>New test of text contrast.</li>
						<li>At this time, it only includes textual visual contrast.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>We propose changing the names of <q>Contrast (Minimum)</q> and <q>Contrast (Enhanced)</q> to <q>Visual Contrast of Text</q> as a signal of a paradigm change from one about color to one about <q>perception of light intensity</q>. The reason for this change is that the understanding of contrast has matured and the available research and body of knowledge has made breakthroughs in advancing the understanding of <q>visual contrast</q>.</p>
				<p>The proposed new guidance more accurately models current research in human visual perception of contrast and light intensity. The goal is to improve understanding of the functional needs of all users, and more effectively match the needs of those who face barriers accessing content. This new perception-based model is more context dependent than a strict light ratio measurement; results can, for example, vary with size of text and the darkness of the colors or background.</p>
				<p>This model is more responsive to user needs and allows designers more choice in visual presentation. It does this by including multi-factor assessment tests which integrate contrast with interrelated elements of visual readability, such as font features. It includes tests to determine an upper limit of contrast, where elevated contrast may impact usability.</p>

			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>Testing has always been important in designing for accessibility. <!-- Web content should be tested by people who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the technology being tested. --></p>
				<section>
				<h4>What types of tests are used?</h4>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Atomic tests</strong>: Tests applied to an object or set of objects within an interface. Similar to the tests for A, AA, and AAA success criteria in WCAG 2.X. (These tests are used to reach a Bronze rating.)</li>
					<li><strong>Holistic tests</strong>: User-centered design methods, assistive technology testing, user and expert usability testing. (These tests are used to reach a silver or gold rating.)</li>
				</ul>
		
				<p>Some content will meet outcomes using atomic tests. Even so, that content may not be usable by the range of people with disabilities. We address this gap with holistic tests.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>How are tests scored?</h4>
				<p>An important goal of WCAG 3.0 was to go beyond binary true/false scoring methods. We include testing options for new guidance, such as rubrics and scales.</p>
				<p>Each outcome has methods related to different technologies. Methods contain tests and techniques for meeting outcomes.</p>
				<p>Tests are applied at the view level and totaled across views. We describe ways that results can be scored by the functional categories they support. Views are a general way of describing digital content such as web pages, pdf documents, ebook pages, mobile screens, the wraparound of virtual reality, and more.</p>
				</section>
			</details>
			
			<section class="status-placeholder">
				<h3>Testing</h3>
				
				<p>WCAG 3.0 tests and scores <a href="#outcomes">outcomes</a>. Outcomes are written as testable criteria that allow testers to objectively determine if the content they are evaluating satisfies the criteria.</p> 
				<p>Testing outcomes uses both <a>views</a> and <a>processes</a> to define what is being tested. Views include all content visually and programmatically available without a substantive change. Processes are a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity/task from end-to-end. When testing processes, the content used to complete the process as well as all of the associated views need to be included in the test.</p>

				<section>
				<h4>Types of tests</h4>
								
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests: <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a> and <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic tests</a>. Testing the outcomes using the atomic tests might involve a combination of <a>automated evaluation</a>, <a>semi-automated evaluation</a>, and <a>human evaluation</a>. <!--The content should be tested by those who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the technology being tested.--></p>
				
				<p>Although content may satisfy all outcomes using the atomic tests, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. The holistic tests address this gap by evaluating more of the user experience than atomic testing.</p>
				<p class="ednote">We are looking for more appropriate terms to distinguish between these two types of tests and welcome suggestions</p> 
					<section>
						<h5>Atomic tests</h5>
						<p>Atomic tests evaluate content, often at an <a>object</a> level, for accessibility. Atomic tests include the existing tests that support A, AA, and AAA <a>success criteria</a> in WCAG 2.X. They also include tests that may require additional context or expertise beyond tests that fit within the WCAG 2.X structure. In WCAG 3.0, atomic tests are used to test both processes and views. Test results are then aggregated across the selected views. Critical errors within selected processes are also totaled. Successful results of the atomic tests are used to reach a <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> rating.</p>
						<p>Atomic tests may be <a>automated</a> or <a>manual</a>. <a>Automated evaluation</a> can be completed without human assistance. These tests allow for a larger scope to be tested but automated evaluation alone cannot determine accessibility. Over time, the number of accessibility tests that can be automated is increasing, but manual testing is still required to evaluate most methods at this time.</p> 
					</section>
					<section>
						<h5>Holistic Tests</h5>
						<p>Holistic tests include assistive technology testing, user-centered design methods, and both user and expert usability testing. Holistic testing applies to the entire declared scope and often uses the declared processes to guide the tests selected. Successful results of holistic tests are used to reach a <a href="#silver">silver</a> or <a href="#gold">gold</a> rating.</p>
					</section>

				</section>
				<section>
				<h4>Technology specific testing</h4>				
				<p>Each outcome includes <a href="#methods">methods</a> associated with different technologies. Each method contains <a>tests</a> and <a>techniques</a> for satisfying the outcome. The outcome is written so that testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies that do not have related methods based solely on the outcome.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Critical errors</h4>
					
					<p>Evaluating <a>processes</a> requires counting <a>Critical errors</a> that occur within the process and associated <a>views</a>. Critical errors are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Errors located anywhere within the view that stop a user from being able to use that view (examples: flashing, keyboard trap, audio with no pause);</li>
						<li>Errors that when located within a <a>process</a> stop a user from completing a process (example: submit button not in tab order); and</li>
						<li>Errors that when aggregated within a view or across a process stop a user from using the view or completing the process (example: a large amount of confusing, ambiguous language).</li>
					</ul>				
					<p><a href="#outcomes">Outcomes</a> include the related critical errors that can occur and how to identify them. Any critical errors will result in the lowest score for the outcome.</p>
					<p class="ednote">We continue to test this approach and others for validity, reliability, sensitivity, and adequacy, and complexity.  Alternatives that we are exploring are noted as separate editor’s notes where applicable. We welcome suggestions on ways to improve the scoring to better meet these criteria.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section class="status-placeholder">
				<h3>Evaluation scope</h3>
				<p class="ednote">The model presented provides a structure for claiming conformance that can be built upon to better accommodate dynamic or very frequently updated content than WCAG 2.X.  We are exploring additional approaches to testing using holistic tests, sampling and/or other alternatives for reaching conformance in situations where testing all content is not possible. We also plan to include a definition and concept for substantially conforming in order to address the potential difficulties presented when testing all content in large digital products and 3rd party content.  </p>
				<p>When evaluating the accessibility of content, WCAG 3.0 requires the outcomes apply to a specific scope. While the scope can be an all content within a digital product, it is usually one or more sub-sets of the whole. Reasons for this include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Large amounts of content are impractical to evaluate comprehensively using anything beyond <a>automated evaluation</a> of <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a>;</li>
					<li>In many cases, content changes frequently, causing evaluation to be accurate only for a specific moment in time;</li>
					<li>Some content is more important to the majority of users than other content; and</li>
					<li>Content that mostly meets the requirements but has problems can interfere with the user's ability to complete a process begun elsewhere.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 therefore defines two inter-related ways to scope content: <a href="#views">views</a> and <a href="#processes">processes</a>. Evaluation is done on one or more complete views or processes, and conformance is determined on the basis of one or more complete views or processes. This is defined further in <a href="#defining-conformance-scope">Defining Conformance Scope</a>.</p>

				<section>
					<h4>Views</h4>
					<p>A view is a single interaction with web content. Conceptually, it corresponds to the definition of a <q>web page</q> as used in WCAG 2.X, but is not restricted to content meeting that definition. Each change of content as understood by the user comprises a new view.</p>
					<p class="ednote">To flesh out more.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Processes</h4>
					<p>A process is a complete activity the user performs using the web content. Example tasks include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Logging into a site and being recognized as an authenticated user;</li>
						<li>Ordering an item, in which case the process includes the entire set of tasks from searching for the item, adding it to the shopping cart, paying for it, and receiving confirmation;</li>
						<li>Submitting tax information, from start to end of the process; and</li>
						<li>Interacting with other users in a virtual reality environment.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A process is comprised of one or more <a href="#views">views</a>.</p>

			<section class="status-exploratory">
				<h3>Scoring</h3>
				<p class="ednote">One of the goals of WCAG 3.0 is to expand scoring tests of methods beyond a binary true/false choice at the page level. We have included tests within the sample outcomes that demonstrate alternatives such as <a>rubrics</a> and <a>scales</a>. We are also exploring integrating these options into <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/">Accessibility Conformance Testing</a> format. We will include example tests in a future draft. Our intent is to include detailed <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/#multiple-ways-to-measure">tests for methods</a> to support each outcome within the WCAG 3.0 model.</p>
				<p>Each <a href="#outcomes"> outcome</a> has <a href="#methods">methods</a> associated with different technologies. Each method contains <a>tests</a> and <a>techniques</a> for meeting that outcome. Testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies that do not have related methods based on the outcome.</p>

				<section>
				<h4>Scoring atomic tests</h4>
				<p>In most cases, testing individual <a>objects</a> will result in binary, pass / fail outcome for each element. This leads to either a pass / fail or a percentage rating depending on the test. A rating scale may be provided for some tests to allow the tester to assign a quality judgement of an element or block of content. Each of these results can be assigned a percentage and the percentage informs the overall score of an outcome.</p>
					<p>Test results for views:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tests that results in a pass or fail condition will be assigned a 100% or 0%;</li>
						<li>Tests at the element level that can be consistently counted will be assigned a percentage (number passed / total number of instances);</li>
						<li>Tests that apply to content without clear boundaries will be scored using a <a>rating scale</a>. The rating scales may vary based on the test and may be presented as numeric scale, an <a>adjectival rating</a> or a <a>rubric</a>. Each of these can be converted into a percentage to make it easier to compare across tests.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>In addition, <a>critical errors</a> within selected processes will be identified and totaled. Any critical errors will result in score of very poor (0).</p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h4>Scoring outcomes</h4>
				<p>The results from the atomic tests are aggregated across views and used along with the number of critical errors to assign an <a>adjectival rating</a> to the outcome. Testers will then use the guidance provided in the outcome along with reasonable judgement of the context that the errors occur in to assign an accessibility score of the outcome.</p>
					<div class="example">
						<p>Potential thresholds for adjectival ratings of test results:</p>
					<dl>
					<dt>Very Poor (0)</dt>
					<dd>Any critical errors or less than 50% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Poor (1)</dt>
					<dd>No critical errors, <abbr title="approximately">approx.</abbr> 50% to 79% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Fair (2)</dt>
						<dd>No critical errors, approx. 80% to 89% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Good  (3)</dt>
						<dd>No critical errors, approx. 90% to 98% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Excellent (4)</dt>
						<dd>No critical errors, approx. 99% to 100% of related tests pass</dd>
				</dl>
						<p class="note">The thresholds are different for different outcomes.</p>
				<p class="ednote">These cut-off points are still being tested and adjusted. These are included as examples to gather feedback on this scoring approach.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h4>Overall scores</h4>
				<p>After all outcomes have been scored, the ratings are averaged for a total score and a score by the <a href="#functional-categories">functional category(ies)</a> they support. Conformance at the <a href="#bronze">bronze</a> level requires no critical errors and at least 3.5 total score and at least a 3.5 score within each functional category.</p>
				
				<p class="ednote">This approach, which allows the tester some flexibility in assigning scores, has the advantage of simplicity and allowing a tester to take the context into account beyond the simple percentages. The second option we are exploring is to carry percentages from tests through to a final score. In this case a bronze rating would require a total score of at least 90% and at least 90% within each functional need category. This number would likely shift as we continue testing.  We invite comment on these options as well as suggestions for an alternative solution.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h4>Scoring holistic tests</h4>			
				<p>The points from <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic tests</a> do not affect the scores of <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a>. Rather a minimum number of holistic tests will need to be met in order to reach a <a href="#silver">silver</a> rating and additional holistic tests will be needed to reach a <a href="#gold">Gold</a> rating. Getting a silver or gold rating requires a Bronze rating.</p>
				<p class="ednote">We continue to work on the scoring of holistic tests and will provide more details in a future iteration of this document.</p>

			<h2>Conformance</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 offers guidance on ways to meet outcomes that reduce barriers and support ease of use. Taken together, this guidance forms a standard. In WCAG 3.0 the outcomes are the requirements for the standard.</p>
				<p>You may want to make a claim that your content or product conforms to the standard. If it does meet the requirements, we call this conformance. There are three levels of conformance: bronze, silver, and gold.</p>
				<p>Each level of conformance requires a number of criteria. To conform to WCAG 3.0, your test results must meet certain thresholds. The bronze level, for example, is the minimum level of conformance. This document details the conformance requirements for each level.</p>
				<p>If you want to make a conformance claim, you must follow the process we describe in this document. Even if you don’t want to make a formal claim, you can use this process to assess the accessibility of content.</p>
				<p>Technology and digital content can conform to WCAG 3.0 without making a claim. The process we offer here will help you get there.</p>
			<p>Conformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the 'requirements' of the standard. In WCAG 3.0 the 'requirements' are the outcomes.</p>
			<p>Technology can meet the outcomes without a conformance claim. If you want to claim conformance, you must follow the process below; however, even if you are not making a formal conformance claim, you can use this process to assess the accessibility of content.</p>
		</details>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance levels</h3>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 defines three levels of conformance: <a href="#bronze">bronze</a>, <a href="#silver">silver</a>, and <a href="#gold">gold</a>.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>Bronze</h4>
					<p>Bronze is the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the bronze level does not conform to WCAG 3.0. The bronze level can be verified using <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a>. While there is a lot of overlap between WCAG 2.X and WCAG 3.0, WCAG 3 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics. As a result, WCAG 3.0 is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.X.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the bronze level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The total score and score within each of the functional categories MUST be at least 3.5; and</li>
						<li><a>Views</a> and <a>processes</a> MUST NOT have <a>critical errors</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Silver</h4>
					<p>Silver is a higher conformance level that addresses additional outcomes. Some <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic testing</a> is necessary to verify conformance to this level.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the silver level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All <a>views</a> MUST satisfy the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> criteria; and</li>
						<li>TBD of holistic tests</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Gold</h4>
					<p>Gold is the highest conformance level that addresses the remaining outcomes described in the guidelines. Additional <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic testing</a> is necessary to verify conformance to this level.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the gold level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All <a>views</a> MUST satisfy the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> criteria; and</li>
						<li>TBD of holistic tests</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Defining conformance scope</h3>
				<p>Conformance is defined only for <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one process and view, a series of processes and views, or multiple related processes and views.  All unique steps in a process MUST be represented in the set of views. Views outside of the process MAY also be included in the scope.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The AG WG and Silver Task Force recognize that representative sampling is an important strategy that large and complex sites use to assess accessibility. While it is not addressed within this document at this time, our intent is to later address it within this document or in a separate document before the guidelines reach the Candidate Recommendation stage. We welcome your suggestions and feedback about the best way to incorporate representative sampling in WCAG 3.0.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance requirements</h3>
				<p>In order for technology to <a>conform</a> to WCAG 3.0, the following conformance requirements apply:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Conformance level</b> - Content MUST meet the requirements of the selected <a href="#conformance-levels">conformance level</a>.</li>
					<li><b>Processes and views</b> - Conformance (and conformance level) MUST apply to complete <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>, and MUST NOT exclude any part of a process or view.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance claims</h3>
				<p>Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 3.0 without making a claim. The material below describes how to make a conformance claim if that option is chosen.</p>
				<section><h4>Required components of a conformance claim</h4><p>A conformance claim MUST include the following information:</p><ol>
						<li><b>Date</b> of the claim;</li>
						<li><b>Guidelines title, version and URI</b>
							<q>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 at ???</q></li>
						<li><b>Conformance level</b> satisfied: (bronze, silver, or gold);</li>
						<li><b>A concise description of the views and processes</b>, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including any state changes which lead to a new view; and</li>
						<li>The technology including the hardware, software, and assistive technology used to test the claim.</li>
						</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Example conformance claim</h4>
					<p>On 12 August 2020, the following 10 views and 2 processes conform to WCAG 3.0 at a bronze level. Processes were selected because they are the most common activities on the site and include 4 unique views. The other 6 views are the most commonly used.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Process 1: Order Newsletter (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, www.example.com/newsletter)</li>
						<li>Process 2: Comment on Blog Post (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a> (with comment model open)</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.example.com/contact">www.example.com/contact</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.example.com/search_results">www.example.com/search_results</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.example.com/recent_news">www.example.com/recent_news</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.example.com/about">www.example.com/about</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.example.com/leadership">www.example.com/leadership</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.example.com/learnmore">www.example.com/learn_more</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>These were tested using Firefox and Chrome on a Windows platform. The assistive technology used included JAWS and Dragon.</p>

				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Outcomes are different from WCAG 2.X success criteria. Compared to success criteria, outcomes are written to be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In plain language; </li>
					<li>More understandable by people who are not experts in technology;</li>
					<li>More user-need oriented instead of technology oriented;</li>
					<li>More granular, so there will be more of them; and</li>
					<li>More flexible to allow more tests than the true/false statements of WCAG 2.X. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The design of outcomes allows more varied needs of people with disabilities than could have been included in WCAG 2.X. </p>
