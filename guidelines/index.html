			<p>The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 provide a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to users with disabilities. Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with blindness, low vision and other vision impairments; deafness and hearing loss; limited movement and dexterity; speech disabilities; sensory disorders; cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other web of things devices. They address various types of web content including static content, interactive content, visual and auditory media, and virtual and augmented reality. The guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>Each <a>guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a>outcomes</a> to determine whether the need has been met. Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a>methods</a> to meet each outcome. </p>
			<p>This specification is expected to be updated regularly to keep pace with changing technology by updating and adding methods, outcomes, and guidelines to address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several levels of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>
			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions, but does not <a>deprecate</a> these versions. WCAG 3.0 will  incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. 
			While there is a lot of overlap between WCAG 2.X and WCAG 3.0, WCAG 3.0 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanisms. As a result, WCAG 3.0 is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.X. WCAG 3.0 does not supersede WCAG 2.2 and previous versions; rather, it is an alternative set of guidelines. Once these guidelines become a W3C Recommendation, the W3C will advise developers, content creators and policy makers to use WCAG 3.0 in order to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. However, content that conforms to earlier versions of WCAG continue to conform to those versions.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<div class="ednote">
        <p>The current proposal for WCAG 3 is made up of different parts and sections, including:</p>
          <ul><li>WCAG3</li>
              <li>WCAG3 Explainer</li>
              <li>Guideline How-tos</li>
              <li>Outcomes</li>
              <li>Methods</li>
              <li>Functional categories</li>
          </ul>
        <p>These parts and sections are inter-related and are continually being refined and updated as more sections are developed. Content is in various states of maturity. The status is marked at the top of each section (see 1.2 Section status levels). Each publication of WCAG 3 will include updates to some, but not necessarily every part and section. This process will facilitate quarterly updates, which provide opportunities for public review and comment throughout the evolution of the guidelines.  As a result, the document is a work in progress. Content will evolve and there may be changes to layout and style that are not yet reflected in all parts of the present release and will be reflected in future releases.  The parts and sections updated in this release are:</p>
          <ul><li>First draft of the WCAG3 Explainer, which takes explanatory material out of WCAG3 to improve usability.</li>
              <li>New conformance section on user-generated content and the glossary definition of user-generated content.
              </li>
              <li>A new proposal revising the Methods template to address comments from the First Public Working Draft (FPWD). This proposal was done in partnership with the ACT task force. </li>
          </ul>

				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 show ways to make web content accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG 3.0 is a newer standard than the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2. You may use WCAG 2.2 or the new standard.</p>
				<p>What’s new in WCAG 3.0?</p>
				 
				<ul>
				<li>WCAG 3.0 includes the needs of people with more types of disabilities.</li>
				<li>It includes mobile and desktop applications, along with web content.</li>
				<li>It has new guidelines and new tests.</li>
				<li>It has new scoring. Your site or product no longer has to pass 100% of the guidelines, as long as people with disabilities can use it.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>

			<section>
				<h3>About WCAG 3.0</h3>
				<p>This introduction provides a <em>brief</em> background to WCAG 3.0. Detailed information about the structure of the guidelines and inputs into their development is available in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/explainer/">Explainer for W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0</a>. That document is recommended reading for anyone new to WCAG 3.</p>
				<p>This specification presents a new model and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities. The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 support a wide set of user needs, use new approaches to testing, and allow frequent maintenance of guidelines and related content to keep pace with accelerating technology change. WCAG 3.0 supports this evolution by focusing on users’ functional needs. These needs are then supported by outcomes and technology-specific methods to meet those needs. </p>
				<p>Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities, including accommodations for blindness, low vision and other vision impairments; deafness and hearing loss; limited movement and dexterity; speech disabilities; sensory disorders; cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make content more usable to users in general as well as accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions, but does not <a>deprecate</a> WCAG 2.X. It will also incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/"> User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/"> Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. These earlier versions provided a flexible model that kept them relevant for over 10 years. However, changing technology and changing needs of people with disabilities have led to the need for a new model to address content accessibility more comprehensively and flexibly.</p>
				<p>There are many differences between WCAG 2.X and WCAG 3.0. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 A &amp; AA is expected to meet most of the minimum conformance level of this new standard but, since WCAG 3.0 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics, additional work will be needed to reach full conformance. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.X, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and other approaches to facilitate migration.</p>

				<h3>Section status levels</h3>
				<p>As part of the WCAG 3.0 drafting process each normative section of this document is given a status. This status is used to indicate how far along in the development this section is, how ready it is for experimental adoption, and what kind of feedback the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is looking for.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong id="status-placeholder">Placeholder</strong>: This content is temporary, it showcases the type of content or section to expect here. All of this is expected to be replaced. No feedback is needed on placeholder content.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-exploratory">Exploratory</strong>: The working group is exploring what direction to take with this section. This content is not refined, details and definitions may be missing. Feedback should be about the proposed direction.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-developing">Developing</strong>: There is rough agreement on what is needed for this section, although not all high-level concerns have been settled. Details have been filled, but are yet to be worked out. Feedback should be focused on ensuring the sections are usable and reasonable in a broad sense.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-refining">Refining</strong>: The working group has reach consensus on this section. It is ready for broad public review and experimental adoption. Feedback should be focused on the feasibility and implementability.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-mature">Mature</strong>: Content is believed by the working group to be ready for recommendation. Feedback should be focused on edge case scenarios the working group may not have anticipated.</li>

				<h3>Relationship to other W3C guidelines</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> [[WCAG20]] were designed to be technology neutral, and have stayed relevant for over 10 years. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]] provide guidance for various types of software that assist people in writing accessible content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis.</p>
				<p>These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG 2.X, ATAG, and UAAG.</li>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 is not backward compatible with WCAG 2.0, ATAG 2.0, and UAAG 2.0.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For more details about differences from previous guidelines, see <a href="#differences-from-wcag-2">Appendix: Differences From WCAG 2</a>.</p>
				<p class="ednote">This version of the guidelines includes an example method for <abbr title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</abbr> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2020/methods/text-alternative-editable/">Author control of text alternatives</a>) and <abbr title="User Agent Accessibility Guidelines">UAAG</abbr> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2020/methods/caption-reflow/"> Reflow of captions and other text in context</a>). Future drafts of the guidelines will include additional examples of ATAG- and UAAG-related content.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Goals and Requirements</h3>
				<p>The goal of WCAG 3.0 and supporting documents is to make digital products including web, ePub, PDF, applications, mobile apps, and other emerging technologies more accessible and usable to people with disabilities. It is the intention for WCAG 3.0 to meet this goal by supporting a wider set of user needs, using new approaches to testing, and allowing more frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. The hope is that WCAG 3.0 will make it significantly easier for both beginners and experts to create accessible digital products that support the needs of people with disabilities.</p>

				<p>Research and design work performed by the Silver Task Force identified key requirements needed to improve upon the existing WCAG 2.X structure. These requirements, presented in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/">Requirements for Silver</a> document, shaped the guidelines that follow and should be taken into account when evaluating and updating the guidelines.</p>
			</section>
			<p class="ednote"> While the majority of guidelines are still to be written and we continue to explore additional ways of validating conformance, we seek wider public review on the approach presented here. </p>
		</section>
		

		<section>
			<h2>Normative requirements</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>There are two types of content in this document:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Normative:</strong> what you must do to meet the guidelines.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-normative:</strong> advice to help you meet the guidelines. This is also called <q>Informative</q>.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			<p>In addition to this section, the <a href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a>, <a href="#testing">Testing</a>, and <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a> sections in WCAG 3.0 provide <a>normative</a> content and define requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as <q>non-normative</q>, diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>
			<p>The key words <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST NOT">MUST NOT</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="NOT RECOMMENDED">NOT RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="RECOMMENDED">RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em>, and <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD NOT">SHOULD NOT</em> are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119]].</p>
			<p class="ednote">Outcomes are normative. The working group is looking for feedback on whether the following should be normative or informative: guidelines, methods, critical errors, and outcome ratings.</p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section data-status="exploratory">
			<h2>Guidelines</h2>
				<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>The following six guideline examples show different features of WCAG 3.0: </p>
					<ul><li>Text alternatives; </li>
					<li>Clear words;</li>
					<li>Captions;</li>
					<li>Structured content (headings); and</li>
					<li>Visual contrast of text (color contrast);</li>
					<li>Error prevention.</li>
					</ul>
			</details>
		
			
			<div class="ednote">
			<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including functional categories of disabilities, general guidelines, outcomes that can be tested, a rich collection of methods, resource links, and code samples.</p>

			<p>The <strong>early drafts of guidelines included here serve as initial examples</strong>. They are used to illustrate what WCAG 3.0 could look like, demonstrate the structure, and test the process of writing content. <strong>These guideline drafts should not be considered as final content of WCAG 3.0</strong>.</p>

			<p>As this draft matures, numbering of individual guidelines will be removed to improve overall usability of the guidelines in response to public requests. WCAG 2.x success criteria will be migrated to this new structure before WCAG 3.0 moves to candidate recommendation.</p>

			<p>As more content is developed, this section will be a list of guidelines with a unique short name, and the text of the requirement written in plain language. To see the overall plan for migrating content from WCAG 2.1 to WCAG 3.0, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCRXrtmnSSTso-6S_IO9GQ3AKTB4FYt9k92eT_1PWX4/edit">WCAG to Silver Outline Map</a>.</p>

			
			<p>The guidelines included in this draft have been selected to show different types of content:</p>

				<li><a href="#text-alternatives">Text alternatives</a> - a direct migration from WCAG 2.X success criterion</li>
				<li><a href="#clear-words">Clear words</a> - new guidance that could not previously be included in WCAG 2.X. It is  based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/"> Making content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities</a> [[coga-usable]].</li>
				<li><a href="#captions">Captions</a> - an example of adapting WCAG 2.X guidance to emerging technologies, such as web virtual reality</li>
				<li><a href="#structured-content">Structured content</a> - migration and merging of several previously unrelated WCAG 2.X success criteria. This revision addresses more diverse disability needs than WCAG 2.X.</li>
				<li><a href="#visual-contrast-of-text">Visual contrast of text</a> - a migration of WCAG 2.X with substantial changes including:
					<ul><li>New calculations of contrast based on more modern research on color perception.</li>
							<li>Merging the 1.4.3 AA and 1.4.6 AAA levels into one guideline.</li>
							<li>New test of text contrast.</li>
							<li>At this time, it only includes textual visual contrast.</li></ul></li>
				<li><a href="#error-prevention">Error Prevention</a> - a migration of WCAG 2.X with substantial changes, including three methods to support the outcome of Input instructions provided for the Error Prevention guideline, which focuses on preventing errors from occurring.</li>

			<h2>Testing</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>What types of tests and scopes are used?</summary>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two (2) types of tests which are evaluated:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Quantitative tests:</strong> Tests where results will not vary based on the tester or approach. Examples include testing whether certain properties exist in the content or if they match a value specified by the requirement.</li>
					<li><strong>Qualitative tests:</strong> Tests that rely on a qualitative evaluation based on existing criteria. Test results may vary between testers who understand the criteria. Examples include evaluating the quality of a requirement such as alternative text.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Tests can be applied to four (4) different scopes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Item:</strong> A component or unit of content. Examples include a drop down menu, a media player, a phrase, or an image.</li>
					<li><strong>View:</strong> All content visually and programmatically available without a user-initiated substantive change.</li>
					<li><strong>User process:</strong> Series of user actions, and the distinct interactive views that support the actions, where each action is required in order to complete an activity.</li>
					<li><strong>Aggregate:</strong> Combination of all related items, user processes, and views.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How well does the testing approach defined here support additional requirements not addressed in 2.1?</li>
					<li>How well does the testing approach defined here support regulatory needs?</li>
					<li>How will these tests be integrated into a conformance model (including levels or scores)?</li>
					<li>For multiple ways to measure, how will organizations declare which specification they are following in a way that is transparent, both to their users and for the purpose of verification in audits?</li>
					<li>As written, outcomes and assertions are at the same level. Would moving assertions to the test level be more effective?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Next steps include:</p>
				<ul>	
					<li>Get feedback from designers, developers and other communities on wording choice.</li>
					<li>Finalize names and descriptions of scope and tests,</li>				
					<li>Develop detailed examples of methods and test,</li>
					<li>Test the accuracy, reliability, repeatability, etc. of this approach,</li>
					<li>Address all github issues under <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/milestone/16" target="_blank">test types and terminology milestone</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>WCAG 3.0 defines <a href="#outcomes">outcomes</a> and  <a>assertions</a>.  Outcomes are written as testable statements that allow testers to reliably determine if the content being evaluated satisfies the criteria. Only outcomes can be tested. Assertions are addressed in  Section 5.</p> 
			<p>Each outcome includes <a>methods</a> associated with different technologies. Each method contains  <a>techniques</a> and <a>sets of tests</a>  for meeting the outcome. The outcome is written so that testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies based solely on the outcome, even when methods do not yet exist for those technologies.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Test scopes</h3>
				<p>Testing outcomes use <a>items</a>, <a>views</a>, <a>user processes</a>, and the <a>aggregate</a> to define what is being tested.</p> 
	
				<p><dfn data-lt="item|unit" title="Smallest testable unit">Items</dfn> are the smallest testable unit. They may be interactive components such as a drop down menu, a link, or a media player. They may also be units of content such as a word, a phrase, a label or error message, an icon, or an image.</p>
	
				<p><dfn data-lt="views" title="All content visually and programmatically available without a substantive change.">Views</dfn> include all content visually and programmatically available without a substantive change. Conceptually, views correspond to the definition of a web page as used in WCAG 2.X, but are not restricted to content meeting that definition. For example, a view could be considered a "screen" in a mobile app or a layer of web content – such as a modal.  </p>
	
				<p><dfn data-lt="user process" title="Series of user actions required in order to complete an activity">User processes</dfn> are a series of user actions, and the distinct interactive <a>views</a> and <a>items</a> that support the actions, where each action is required in order to complete an activity. A user process may include a subset of items in a view or a group of views.</p>
				<p>Examples of a process include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Logging into a site and being recognized as an authenticated user;</li>
					<li>Ordering an item, in which case the process includes the entire set of tasks from searching for the item, adding it to the shopping cart, paying for it, and receiving confirmation;</li>
					<li>Submitting tax information, from start to end of the process; and</li>
					<li>Interacting with other users in a virtual reality environment.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A process is comprised of one or more <a>views</a> or subsets of views. Only the part of the views that support the user process are included. in a test of user process.</p>
	
				<p>The <dfn title="set of items, views, and user processes that comprise the site">aggregate</dfn> is the combination of items, views, and user processes that collectively comprise the site, set of web pages, web app, etc.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Types of tests</h3>
					<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two (2) types of tests which are evaluated:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Quantitative tests:</strong> Tests where results will not vary based on the tester or approach. Examples include testing whether certain properties exist in the content or if they match a value specified by the requirement.</li>
					<li><strong>Qualitative tests:</strong> Tests that rely on a qualitative evaluation based on existing criteria. Test results may vary between testers who understand the criteria. One example is evaluating the quality of a requirement such as alternative text.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Most tests have prescribed ways to meet the test. In some cases, the ways to meet the test will change based on a specific condition being met (example: the language the content is written in).</p>

				<p>Although content may satisfy all outcomes using quantitative and qualitative tests, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. The assertions section below attempts to address this problem. </p>

				<section>
					<h4>Quantitative tests</h4>
					<p>Quantitative tests rely on measuring properties of the content based on nominal values. The test results are objectively verifiable, to avoid variation of test results between different testers. Values are quantitative, and could be boolean, for example to check the presence of titles, text alternatives, and accessible names. Other values could include numerical thresholds; for example, to check color luminosity ratios.</p>
					<p>Each method using quantitative tests includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the values being tested; and</li>
						<li>an algorithm to measure the properties of the content based on the values.</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="example">
						<p>Example quantitative test</p>
						<p>These tests are already part of WCAG 2.x.</p>
						<p>Example for 1.1.1: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/23a2a8/" target="_blank">Image has non-empty accessible name</a></p>
						<p>Example for 1.4.3: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/afw4f7/proposed/" target="_blank">Text has minimum contrast</a></p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Qualitative tests</h4>
					<p>Qualitative tests rely on evaluating content based on a set of defined expectations and exceptions. The set of expectations and exceptions limit the scope of decisions, to minimize variation of test results arrived at by different testers. Still, some level of qualitative assessment is required, therefore the accuracy of the test results also depends on the knowledge and context of the testers to some degree.</p>
					<p>Each method using qualitative tests includes:</p> 
					<ul>
						<li>the defined expectations being tested; and</li>
						<li>guidance on evaluating how well the content meets the defined expectations.</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="example">
						<p>Example qualitative test</p>
						<p>These tests are already part of WCAG 2.x.</p>
						<p>Example for 1.1.1: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/qt1vmo/proposed/" target="_blank">Image accessible name is descriptive </a></p>
						<p>Example for 2.4.6: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/cc0f0a/proposed/" target="_blank">Form Field Label is Descriptive</a></p>
					</aside>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Conditions</h4>
						<p>Some tests only apply in certain situations. Testing may occasionally require determining and referencing which specifications are being tested against.  Methods will note whether a test always applies or under what conditions a test applies.  </p>

						<aside class="example">
							<p>Example conditions include:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>If the same interface is translated into more than one language with different grammatical rules, and some tests may have different conformance requirements for each language</li>
							<li>An interface with multiple contrast modes will have different contrast requirements than an interface with only a default contrast mode.</li>
							<li>Reading Level might be measured using the Flesch-Kincaid readability test or Automatic Readability Assessment</li>
						</ul>
						</aside>

					</section>

						<section>
					<h3>Critical Issues</h3>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>This section is exploratory. 
						<p>Severity rating could contribute towards scoring and prioritization. This is a potential way to replace how A/AA/AAA levels represented severity by incorporating a mechanism to evaluate severity as a part of testing.</p> 
						<p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>What to do with non-critical issues?</li>
							<li>How best to assign severity, particularly if testers have different ideas on what is critical?</li>
							<li>How do we incorporate context/process/task? Is that part of scoping, or issue severity? Both are important to the end result.</li>
							<li>If included, how will situations where   severity depends on context be handled?</li>
							<li>Can the matrix inform designation of functional categories? For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2021/outcomes/text-alternative-available">Text Alternative Available outcome</a>.</li>
							<li>How will issue severity fit into levels? For example:<ul>
									<li>"Bronze" could be an absence of any critical or high issues;</li>
									<li>"Silver" could be an absence of any critical, high, or medium issues.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>How to account for cumulative issues becoming critical?</li>
							<li>Would another approach be more effective, for example assigning critical issues after testing is complete based on task or type of task rather than by test.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>

					<p>Tests will include critical issues. Each test will have a category of severity, so some tests will be flagged as causing a critical issue.  Examples of critical issues in tests are at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/silver/Editor-draft-cleanup/methods/functional-images/tests.html">Text Alternative Available</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/silver/Editor-draft-cleanup/methods/text-equiv/tests.html">Translates Speech And Non-Speech Audio</a>.</p>

				<h3>Assertions</h3>
				<p>An Assertion is a formal claim of fact, attributed to a person or organization. In WCAG 3, an assertion is an attributable and documented statement of fact regarding procedures practiced in the development and maintenance of the content or product to improve accessibility. Assertions are only testable in that one can test that the assertion has been made correctly - not that any desired result has occurred. The results are always true/false.</p>

				<p>WCAG 3 recommends but does not require additional supporting documentation that an organization can use to improve to support the procedure or assertion but does not require it.</p>
				</section>
			<section data-status="exploratory">				
				<h3>Using Assertions</h3>
				<p>Assertions may supplement methods in one or more outcomes. Assertions should only be used on outcomes and guidelines that allow assertions.  Organizations can make an assertion that they followed a procedure to claim conformance at the Silver or Gold level.</p>

				<p class="ednote">The AGWG is considering whether and how assertions can be applied to the Bronze level.</p>

				<p>Procedures used in assertions may be implemented during implementation or as part of evaluation.</p>

				<div class="ednote">
					<p>The AGWG is considering what will be qualify as a procedure in WCAG 3. A procedure may be limited to guidance:
						<ul><li>approved by AGWG and listed in WCAG,</li>
						<li>that references publicly published guidance, or</li>
						<li>that meets criteria specified in WCAG</li></ul>
					or it may be any process that an organization uses to improve accessibility.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Examples of procedures that may be addressed by assertions used during implementation might include:</p>
					<ul><li>Training</li>
					<li>FTE (Full Time Equivalent) assignments</li>
					<li>Skills testing</li>
					<li>Coordination and documentation of accessibility processes</li>
					<li>Setting the priority for remediation</li></ul> 
				<p>Examples of procedures that evaluate accessibility might include:</p>
					<ul><li>Usability testing</li>
					<li>Heuristic evaluation</li>
					<li>Screen reader testing</li></ul>
			</section>

			<section data-status="exploratory">			
				<h3>Documenting Assertions</h3>

					<p>Assertions should be documented as part of the conformance claim process.  The required information may also be made available through the web site.</p> 

					<p>Assertions include the following information:</p>
						<ul><li>The statement being asserted</li>
						<li>The date of the assertion</li>
						<li>The date or date range the procedure was completed</li>
						<li>The scope of the assertion</li>
						<li>Contact information for the person or group making the assertion</li>
						<li>The outcome(s) or guideline(s) supported by the assertion</li></ul>

				<p class="ednote">The alternative to specifying assertions at the outcome or guideline level will be to require the assertion apply to the scope of the conformance claim.</p>
			</section>

			<section data-status="exploratory">			
				<h3>Supplemental Information</h3>
				<p>WCAG recommends additional information that can support procedures. It will not require organizations to provide supplemental information to conform.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The AGWG will add to this section as other areas are confirmed.</p>
			</section>

			<section data-status="exploratory">			
				<h3>Testing Assertions</h3>
				<p>The quality of an assertion can be tested based on how well the assertion meets the documentation requirements for assertions (See Documenting Assertions). Supplemental information is not tested in order to conform to WCAG; however, regulatory organizations may decide to adopt additional documentation requirements based on the procedure being asserted. </p>

			<h2>Conformance</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>You might want to make a claim that your content or product meets the WCAG 3.0 outcomes. If it does meet the outcomes, we call this “conformance.” To conform to WCAG 3.0, your test results must show that your project is accessible.</p>
				<p>If you want to make a conformance claim, you must use the process described in this document. Your content can conform to WCAG 3.0, even if you don’t want to make a claim. You can still use this process to test your project’s accessibility.</p>	
			</details>
			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Conformance levels</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
				<p>WCAG 3.0 will include a new conformance model in order to address a wider range of user needs, test a wider range of technologies and support new approaches to testing. There are several key goals for this new conformance model:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Develop a model that encourages websites to continue to do better and better (vs. stopping at the previous AA level);</li>
					<li>Better reflect the lived experience of people with disabilities, who successfully use sites that have some content that does not meet WCAG 2.0 AA, or who encounter barriers with sites that meet WCAG 2.0 AA;</li>
					<li>Allow for bugs and oversight by content authors, provided the impact of them is limited to users with disabilities.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>To do this, the conformance model prioritizes content needed to complete tasks while still testing the entire view for accessibility errors.  This priority is reflected in the scoring system, which does not allow for errors along the paths needed to complete processes but allow for some accessibility errors outside process completion.  This means that sites may conform at the lowest level (Bronze), while still containing a small amount of content that does not meet one or more guidelines, so long as that content doesn’t prevent people with disabilities from successfully using the site.</p>

				<p>We seek feedback on whether this flexibility will be beneficial in encouraging content providers to meet conformance because it is more achievable or whether content providers are less likely to improve accessibility if they aren't required to. We also seek feedback on the conformance approach as a whole.</p>
				</div>

				<p>WCAG 3.0 defines three levels of conformance: <a href="#bronze">bronze</a>, <a href="#silver">silver</a>, and <a href="#gold">gold</a>.</p>

				<section>
					<h4>Bronze</h4>
					<p>Bronze is the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the bronze level does not conform to WCAG 3.0. While there is a lot of overlap between WCAG 2 and WCAG 3, WCAG 3 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics. As a result, WCAG 3.0 is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.X.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Silver</h4>
					<p>Silver is a higher conformance level.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Gold</h4>
					<p>Gold is the highest conformance level.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<h3>Conformance Option 1</h3>
				<p class="ednote">We are exploring two different approaches to conformance. We continue to test these approaches and others for validity, reliability, sensitivity, adequacy, and complexity.   We welcome suggestions on ways to improve them to better meet these criteria.

			<section data-status="exploratory">
			<h3>User generated content</h3>
			<p>Web content publishers may include content provided by the users of their digital products. We refer to such content as "<a href="#user-generated-content">User Generated Content</a>".</p>
			<p>Examples of User Generated Content include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>social media postings and comments,</li>
					<li>uploaded photographs, or</li>
					<li>uploaded videos or other multimedia.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>User Generated Content is provided for publication by visitors where the content platform specifically welcomes and encourages it. User-generated content is content that is submitted through a user interface designed specifically for members of the public and customers. Use of the same user interface as an authoring tool for publication of content by agents of the publisher (such as employees, contractors, or authorized volunteers) acting on behalf of the publisher does not make that content User Generated Content. The purpose of the User Generated Content Conformance is to allow WCAG 3 outcomes and methods to require additional or different steps to improve the accessibility of User Generated Content.</p>
			<p>An important part of WCAG Conformance is the specific guidance that is associated with individual WCAG 3 guidelines and outcomes. Not all WCAG 3 guidelines will have unique outcomes and testing for User Generated Content. Unless User Generated Content requirements are specified in a particular guideline, that guideline applies as written whether or not the content is User Generated. </p>
			
			<p class="ednote">We plan for a future Working Draft to include specific examples of guidelines with additional requirements for user generated content.  One example would be 'alternative text'. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) has specific guidance for providing a mechanism for alternative text. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b23">ATAG  2.0 Guideline B.2.3</a> - "Assist authors with managing alternative content for non-text content" could be adapted to provide specific, guideline-related guidance for user generated alternative text. </p>
			
			<p>The web content publisher should identify all locations of User Generated Content (such as commentary on hosted content, product descriptions for consumer to consumer for sale listings, and restaurant reviews) and perform standard accessibility evaluation analysis for each. If there are no accessibility issues, the User Generated Content is fully conforming.</p>
			<section>
			<h4>Steps to Conform</h4>
			<p>If accessibility issues are identified, or if the website author wants to proactively address potential accessibility issues that might arise from User Generated Content, then all of the following must be indicated alongside the User Generated Content or in an Accessibility Statement published on the site or product that is linked from the view or page in a consistent location:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Clearly identify where User Generated Content can be found on the publisher's digital product (perhaps by id href);</li>
				<li>Clearly identify the steps taken to encourage accessibility in User Generated Content such as prompting the user for ALT text for their uploaded images before they are accepted and the disallowal of text attributes except as they are part of semantic markup such as strong, headings, etc., as enumerated in Guideline Outcomes;</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="ednote">Editor's Note: Once the conformance approach is included, content that passes all tests will be considered fully conformant. It remains to be determined how to address User Generated Content that has accessibility issues; and to define what minimum thresholds might be acceptable. We expect WCAG 3 to provide this guidance within individual guidelines and outcomes and to support testing for conformance. The working group is looking at alternative requirements to apply to User Generated Content guideline by guideline, and is seeking feedback on what would serve as reasonable requirements on how to best support accessibility in User Generated Content with known (or anticipated) accessibility issues. The working group intends to more thoroughly address the contents and the location of an accessibility statement in a future draft.</p>

				<h3>Conforming alternative version</h3>
				<p class="ednote">For this first draft, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has focused on the basic conformance model. For a next draft, we will explore how <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternative versions</a> fit into the new conformance model.</p>
			</section>

				<h3>Only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies</h3>
				<p class="ednote">For this first draft, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has focused on the basic conformance model. For a next draft, we will explore how <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc4">accessibility-supported</a> fits into the new conformance model.</p>
			</section>
			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Defining conformance scope</h3>
				<p>When evaluating the accessibility of content, WCAG 3.0 requires the outcomes apply to a specific scope. While the scope can be an all content within a digital product, it is usually one or more sub-sets of the whole. Reasons for this include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Large amounts of content are impractical to evaluate comprehensively using anything beyond <a>automated evaluation</a> of atomic tests;</li>
					<li>In many cases, content changes frequently, causing evaluation to be accurate only for a specific moment in time;</li>
					<li>Some content is more important to the majority of users than other content; and</li>
					<li>Content that mostly meets the requirements but has problems can interfere with the user's ability to complete a process begun elsewhere.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 therefore defines two inter-related ways to scope content: <a>views</a> and <a>processes</a>. Evaluation is done on one or more complete views or processes, and conformance is determined on the basis of one or more complete views or processes. </p>

				<p>Conformance is defined only for <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one process and view, a series of processes and views, or multiple related processes and views.  All unique steps in a process MUST be represented in the set of views. Views outside of the process MAY also be included in the scope.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The AG WG and Silver Task Force recognize that representative sampling is an important strategy that large and complex sites use to assess accessibility. While it is not addressed within this document at this time, our intent is to later address it within this document or in a separate document before the guidelines reach the Candidate Recommendation stage. We welcome your suggestions and feedback about the best way to incorporate representative sampling in WCAG 3.0.</p>

				<h3>Conformance requirements</h3>
				<p>In order for technology to <a>conform</a> to WCAG 3.0, the following conformance requirements apply:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Conformance level</b> - Content MUST meet the requirements of the selected <a href="#conformance-levels">conformance level</a>.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Conformance claims</h3>
				<p>Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 3.0 without making a claim. The material below describes how to make a conformance claim if that option is chosen.</p>
				<section><h4>Required components of a conformance claim</h4><p>A conformance claim MUST include the following information:</p><ol>
						<li><b>Date</b> of the claim;</li>
						<li><b>Guidelines title, version and URI</b>
							<q>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 at ???</q></li>
						<li><b>Conformance level</b> satisfied: (bronze, silver, or gold);</li>
						<li><b>A concise description of the views and processes</b>, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including any state changes which lead to a new view; and</li>
						<li>The technology including the hardware, software, and assistive technology used to test the claim.</li>
						</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Example conformance claim</h4>
					<p>On 12 August 2020, the following 10 views and 2 processes conform to WCAG 3.0 at a bronze level. Processes were selected because they are the most common activities on the site and include 4 unique views. The other 6 views are the most commonly used.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Process 1: Order Newsletter (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, www.example.com/newsletter)</li>
						<li>Process 2: Comment on Blog Post (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a> (with comment model open)</li>

				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Outcomes are different from WCAG 2.X success criteria. Compared to success criteria, outcomes are written to be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In plain language; </li>
					<li>More understandable by people who are not experts in technology;</li>
					<li>More user-need oriented instead of technology oriented;</li>
					<li>More granular, so there will be more of them; and</li>
					<li>More flexible to allow more tests than the true/false statements of WCAG 2.X. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The design of outcomes allows more varied needs of people with disabilities than could have been included in WCAG 2.X. </p>
				<p>Methods map approximately to WCAG 2.X Techniques documents.</p>
