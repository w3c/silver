			<p>The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 provide a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to users with disabilities. Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with blindness, low vision and other vision impairments; deafness and hearing loss; limited movement and dexterity; speech disabilities; sensory disorders; cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other web of things devices. They address various types of web content including static content, interactive content, visual and auditory media, and virtual and augmented reality. The guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>Each <a href="#guidelines-structure">guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a href="#outcomes">outcomes</a> to determine whether the need has been met. Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a href="#methods-structure">methods</a> to meet each outcome. </p>
			<p>This specification is expected to be updated regularly to keep pace with changing technology by updating and adding methods, outcomes, and guidelines to address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several levels of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>
			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions, but does not <a>deprecate</a> these versions. WCAG 3.0 will  incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. 
			While there is a lot of overlap between WCAG 2.X and WCAG 3.0, WCAG 3.0 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanisms. As a result, WCAG 3.0 is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.X. WCAG 3.0 does not supersede WCAG 2.2 and previous versions; rather, it is an alternative and more modern set of guidelines. Once these guidelines become a W3C Recommendation, the W3C will advise developers, content creators and policy makers to use WCAG 3.0 in order to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. However, content that conforms to earlier versions of WCAG continue to conform to those versions.</p>

			<section>
			<h3>About WCAG 3.0</h3>
			<p>This specification presents a new model and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities. The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 support a wide set of user needs, use new approaches to testing, and allow frequent maintenance of guidelines and related content to keep pace with accelerating technology change. WCAG 3.0 supports this evolution by focusing on users’ functional needs. These needs are then supported by outcomes and technology-specific methods to meet those needs. </p>
			<p>Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities, including accommodations for blindness, low vision and other vision impairments; deafness and hearing loss; limited movement and dexterity; speech disabilities; sensory disorders; cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make content more usable to users in general as well as accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
			<p>WCAG 3.0 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions, but does not <a>deprecate</a> WCAG 2.X. It will also incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/"> User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/"> Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. These earlier versions provided a flexible model that kept them relevant for over 10 years. However, changing technology and changing needs of people with disabilities have led to the need for a new model to address content accessibility more comprehensively and flexibly.</p>
			<p>There are many differences between WCAG 2.X and WCAG 3.0. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 A &amp; AA is expected to meet most of the minimum conformance level of this new standard but, since WCAG 3.0 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics, additional work will be needed to reach full conformance. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2.X, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and other approaches to facilitate migration.</p>
				<p class="ednote">This version of the guidelines includes an example method for <abbr title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</abbr> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2020/methods/text-alternative-editable/">Author control of text alternatives</a>) and <abbr title="User Agent Accessibility Guidelines">UAAG</abbr> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2020/methods/caption-reflow/"> Reflow of captions and other text in context</a>). Future drafts of the guidelines will include additional examples of ATAG- and UAAG-related content.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h3>Background on WCAG 3.0</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/">Silver Community Group</a> and their research partners conducted a year of research which included a literature review as well as interviews, surveys, and self-reporting with people with disabilities, content developers, quality assurance professionals, tool developers, designers and policy makers.</p>
				<p>The results are available in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1POs7orJ4ALB0bq5_vyo4v8RxDcr-5ctwD1noVgpXuJc/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0">The Research Summary Slide Deck</a>. One recurring theme was positive perceptions about the popularity and quality of the guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were changes in the structure and presentation of accessibility guidance to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>improve usability — especially for beginners;</li>
					<li>support disability needs that cannot be tested by true/false success criteria; and</li>
					<li>facilitate maintenance to keep the guidelines more current.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The goal of WCAG 3.0 is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products on a variety of platforms. WCAG 3.0 uses a model that allows it to address more disability needs than WCAG 2.X, as well as address publishing requirements and emerging technologies such as web XR (augmented, virtual and mixed reality) and voice input. It will also provide non-<a>normative</a> information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies. The WCAG 3.0 model is designed to support better coverage across disabilities and be easier to maintain, so that the new model will be more enduring over time as technologies evolve.</p>

			<section>
				<h3>Relationship to other W3C guidelines</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> [[WCAG20]] were designed to be technology neutral, and have stayed relevant for over 10 years. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]] provide guidance for various types of software that assist people in writing accessible content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis.</p>
				<p>These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG 2.X, ATAG, and UAAG.</li>
					<li>WCAG 3.0 is not backward compatible with WCAG 2.0, ATAG 2.0, and UAAG 2.0.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Goals and Requirements</h3>
				<p>The goal of WCAG 3.0 and supporting documents is to make digital products including web, ePub, PDF, applications, mobile apps, and other emerging technologies more accessible and usable to people with disabilities. It is the intention for WCAG 3.0 to meet this goal by supporting a wider set of user needs, using new approaches to testing, and allowing more frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. The hope is that WCAG 3.0 will make it significantly easier for both beginners and experts to create accessible digital products that support the needs of people with disabilities.</p>

				<p>Research and design work performed by the Silver Task Force identified key requirements needed to improve upon the existing WCAG 2.X structure. These requirements, presented in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/">Requirements for Silver</a> document, shaped the guidelines that follow and should be taken into account when evaluating and updating the guidelines.</p>
			</section>
			<p class="ednote"> While the majority of guidelines are still to be written and we continue to explore additional ways of validating conformance, we seek wider public review on the approach presented here. </p>

			<h2>Structure of these guidelines</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Guidelines:</strong> solutions to accessibility problems.</li>
					<li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> the desired result (or “outcome”) of reducing accessibility problems. This is what you test for.</li>
					<li><strong>Methods:</strong> detailed ways and tests for rating how well your project meets an outcome.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some of these sections are in this document. You can find others in links within the sections.</p>
			</details>
			<figure id="guidelines-structure-diagram" aria-labelledby="guidelines-structure-description" class="figure-float">
				<img src="img/structure-core.svg" />
				<figcaption>Core Structure</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a href="#guidelines-structure-diagram">Figure 1</a> shows <span id="guidelines-structure-description">the core structure of WCAG 3.0. WCAG 3.0 has three levels of content with associated documentation. Guidelines form the top level. Each guideline contains multiple outcomes, with associated critical errors and outcomes scoring. Each outcome contains multiple methods, with an associated description and examples, tests, and test scoring.</span></p>
			<section>
				<h3>Guidelines structure</h3>
				<p>Guidelines provide a high-level, plain-language version of the content for managers, policy makers, individuals who are new to accessibility, and other individuals who need to understand the concepts but not dive into the technical details. They provide an easy-to-understand way of organizing and presenting the outcomes so that non-experts can learn about and understand the concepts. Each guideline includes a unique, descriptive name along with a high-level plain-language summary. Guidelines address functional needs on specific topics, such as contrast, forms, readability, and more. Guidelines group related outcomes and are technology-independent.</p>				
				<p class="example">Example: Use sections, headings, and sub-headings to organize your content.</p>			
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Outcomes structure</h3>
				<p>Each guideline contains multiple outcomes. Outcomes result from practices that reduce or eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience. Outcomes form the basis of a flexible and expansive architecture for accessibility guidelines that closely relates to the needs of people with disabilities. Outcomes are designed for use by developers, testers, and other technical experts. 
				</p>
				<p> Outcomes are written as testable criteria and include information on how to score the outcome in an optional <a href="#conformance-claims">Conformance Claim</a>. Within a guideline, outcomes have an AND relationship. All relevant outcomes must be addressed but not all outcomes will apply to all technologies and situations. When an outcome does not apply, it is marked NA in the scoring.</p>

				<p class="example">Example: Convey hierarchy with semantic structure</p>
				<section>
					<h4>Critical errors</h4>
						<p><a href="#outcomes">Outcomes</a> include the related <a>critical errors</a> that can occur and how to identify them. Not all outcomes have critical errors.  Any critical errors will result in the lowest score for the outcome.</p>
					
					<p>Evaluating <a>processes</a> requires counting critical errors that occur within the process and associated <a>views</a>. Critical errors are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Errors located anywhere within the view that stop a user from being able to use that view (examples: flashing, keyboard trap, audio with no pause);</li>
						<li>Errors that when located within a <a>process</a> stop a user from completing a process (example: submit button not in tab order); and</li>
						<li>Errors that when aggregated within a view or across a process stop a user from using the view or completing the process (example: a large amount of confusing, ambiguous language).</li>
					</ul>				
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Outcome rating</h4>
					<p>Each outcome is rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The rating model is designed to be flexible in order to allow more functional needs of people with disabilities to be included in the guidelines. </p>
					<p>Each outcome defines the rating criteria used for that outcome.  The rating criteria are designed to be technology agnostic but tie to the available methods so that method level scoring can be rolled up when possible or the tester can make an informed judgment call about the outcome rating. </p>

				</section> 
			</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Methods structure</h3>
					<figure id="method_screenshot" aria-labelledby="method_screenshot_description" class="figure-float screenshot">
						<img src="img/method.png" />
							<figcaption>Screenshot of a Method for Structured Content</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Each outcome has one or more <a href="#methods-structure">methods</a>. There are three types of methods:</p>
					<ul>					
						<li><strong>All</strong> - Methods that apply across all technologies. </li>
						<li><strong>Technology specific</strong> - Methods that apply to one of a predetermined list of technologies such as HTML, PDF, or VR. </li>
						<li><strong>Fallback</strong> - Methods that apply to emerging or proprietary technology and for technology that does not yet have a method written</li>
					</ul>
					<p>When technology specific methods are provided, the outcomes will also include one or more fallback methods.</p>
					
					<p id="method_screenshot_description">The methods include detailed information on how to meet the outcome, code samples, working examples, resources, as well as information about testing and scoring the method.</p>
					
					<p class="example">Example: Semantic headings (HTML)</p>
					<p class="note">While WCAG 3 Methods have some similarity with WCAG 2 Techniques, they are not the same and are not interchangeable.</p>
					
					<section>
						<h4>Description</h4>
						<p>Each method includes a detailed technical description of the method with including instructions on how the method works that do not depend on examples.  If there are dependencies between methods, these are also listed here.  Dependencies between methods will be a rare situation.</p> 
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Examples</h4>
						<p>Each method also includes working code samples and detailed examples.  </p>
					</section>
					<section>
				
						<h4>Tests</h4>
						<p>Tests provide ways to check that methods and techniques have been followed. Tests include step-by-step instructions on evaluating the method based on the technology being used. Tests may vary by technology as needed.</p>
						<p> Tests specify the unit being tested and the approach to scoring for that test. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Test Scoring</h4>
						<p>Each method includes information on how to score individual instances of the test. The testing results for methods inform the rating of the related outcome.</p>
				
					</section>
				</section>
			</section>

		<section class="informative">
			<h4>Additional Documentation and Scoring Information</h4>
		
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>How-to information:</strong> advice written in plain language, including information on how to get started with accessibility.</li>
					<li><strong>Functional needs:</strong> how to solve the access problems that people face.</li>
					<li><strong>Functional categories:</strong> groups of disability types.</li>
					<li><strong>Conformance levels:</strong> scoring your project’s accessibility. There are three levels for your project’s final score: bronze, silver, or gold. Scoring is not required.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some of these sections are in this document. You can find others in links within the sections.</p>
			</details>

		<p>The core structure has inter-relationships with supporting documents and the scoring process. <span id="guidelines--full-structure-description"> Functional needs inform both outcomes and functional categories. The tests within methods are used to inform the scores for each outcome. Then outcome scores are aggregated to create scores by functional category and an overall score. These then result in a bronze rating.  Silver and gold ratings build on the bronze rating to demonstrate improved accessibility. General information about guidelines is available in How To documents. </span></p>

				<section>
					<h3>How tos</h3>
					<p>The <a>How-To</a> content provides explanatory material for each guideline that applies across technologies. This guidance explains how to apply the concepts presented in the guidelines for non-technical readers. This plain language resource includes information on getting started, who the guideline helps and how, as well information for project managers, designers and developers.  </p>

							<figcaption>Example screenshot of a How-To for Structured Content</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p id="howTo_screenshot_description">The example of a How-To for Structured Content provides basic information organized by tabs to help people get started with accessibility for structured content, plan for implementing accessible structured content across a project, design accessible structured content, and basics for developers new to accessibility of structured content. It also includes information on examples, the outcomes for meeting the guideline, and resources.</p>
				</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Functional needs</h3>
				<p>The development of WCAG 3 guidelines starts with <a>functional needs</a>. A functional need is a statement that describes a specific gap in one’s ability, or a specific mismatch between ability and the designed environment or context. Functional needs are applied to specific topics (for example: contrast, forms, readability, and more) to identify the barriers experienced by people with disabilities. The barriers in these topics inform the <a href="#outcomes">outcomes</a>, which state the conditions to test whether the functional needs have been met. Functional needs are documented in the how-tos, supplementary material accompanying the guidelines.</p>
				<p class="example">Example: Use without vision.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The work of cataloging functional needs is still in process and will continue after the First Public Working Draft.  Those interested can see more information in the draft <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2020/functional-needs/">Functional Needs</a>.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Functional categories</h3>
				<p>Functional categories of disabilities group the functional needs of users with disabilities. Functional categories are used when reporting test results in the optional conformance claim.</p>
				<p>Functional categories are similar to functional performance criterial in <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/draft-rule-2011/chapter-3-functional-performance-criteria">Section 508</a> [[508-criteria]] and functional performance statements in <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101500_101599/101550/01.01.01_60/tr_101550v010101p.pdf">en 301 549</a> [[en-301-549]]. The current list of functional categories is: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Vision and Visual</li>
					<li>Hearing and Auditory</li>
					<li>Sensory Intersections</li>
					<li>Mobility </li>
					<li>Motor</li>
					<li>Physical and Sensory Intersections</li>
					<li>Speech</li>
					<li>Attention</li>
					<li>Language and Literacy</li>
					<li>Learning</li>
					<li>Memory</li>
					<li>Executive</li>
					<li>Mental Health</li>
					<li>Cognitive and Sensory Intersections</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="ednote">The list of functional categories is a draft.  Creating meaningful groupings is still a work in progress and currently evolving along with the work on cataloging functional needs. This work will continue after the First Public Working Draft.  Those interested can see more information in the document <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2020/functional-needs/">DRAFT Functional Needs</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Conformance Levels</h3>
				<p>WCAG 3 has an optional scoring system that can better inform organizations on the quality of their accessibility effort. The optional conformance levels provide a way for organizations to report their conformance in simple manner. The bronze level is based on the score in each functional category and the overall score. Silver and gold levels require conforming at the bronze level plus additional improved usability for people with disabilities.</p>
				<p class="ednote">This first draft focuses on bronze level. Future drafts will have more information on silver and gold levels. We expect that bronze will be similar to WCAG 2 AA, while silver and gold will include more usability-type testing. This is still under development. WCAG 2.X AAA success criteria are generally included in WCAG 3. The design of the scoring model awards more points for implementing the outcomes that come from WCAG 2.X AAA.</p>

			<h2>Normative requirements</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>There are two types of content in this document:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Normative:</strong> what you must do to meet the guidelines.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-normative:</strong> advice to help you meet the guidelines. This is also called <q>Informative</q>.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			<p>In addition to this section, the <a href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a>, <a href="#testing">Testing</a>, and <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a> sections in WCAG 3.0 provide <a>normative</a> content and define requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as <q>non-normative</q>, diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>
			<p>The key words <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST NOT">MUST NOT</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="NOT RECOMMENDED">NOT RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="RECOMMENDED">RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD">SHOULD</em>, and <em class="rfc2119" title="SHOULD NOT">SHOULD NOT</em> are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119]].</p>
			<p class="ednote">Outcomes are normative. The working group is looking for feedback on whether the following should be normative or informative: guidelines, methods, critical errors, and outcome ratings.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Testing</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>What types of tests are used?</summary>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests:</p>
					<ul><li><strong>Atomic tests:</strong> simple tests (usually of the code), like the way we test today. You use these tests to reach the bronze level.</li>
					<li><strong>Holistic tests:</strong> usability tests and manual tests with hardware and software used by people with disabilities (assistive technologies). You use these tests to reach the silver or gold level.</li></ul>
					<p>Some content will meet outcomes if it passes atomic tests, but that content still might not be usable by all people with disabilities. Holistic tests can help you fix that.</p>

			</details>
			
			<p class="ednote">The model presented provides a structure for testing that can be built upon to better accommodate dynamic or very frequently updated content than WCAG 2.X.  We are exploring additional approaches to testing using holistic tests, sampling and/or other alternatives for reaching conformance in situations where testing all content is not possible. We also plan to include a definition and concept for substantially conforming in order to address the potential difficulties presented when testing all content in large digital products and 3rd party content.  </p>
			
				<p>WCAG 3.0 tests and scores <a href="#outcomes">outcomes</a>. Outcomes are written as testable criteria that allow testers to objectively determine if the content they are evaluating satisfies the criteria.</p> 
				<p>Testing outcomes uses both <a>views</a> and <a>processes</a> to define what is being tested. Views include all content visually and programmatically available without a substantive change. Processes are a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity/task from end-to-end. When testing processes, the content used to complete the process as well as all of the associated views need to be included in the test.</p>
			<section>
					<h3>Views</h3>
					<p>A view is a single interaction with content. Conceptually, it corresponds to the definition of a <q>web page</q> as used in WCAG 2.X, but is not restricted to content meeting that definition. Each change of content as understood by the user comprises a new view.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Processes</h3>
					<p>A process is a complete activity the user performs. Example tasks include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Logging into a site and being recognized as an authenticated user;</li>
						<li>Ordering an item, in which case the process includes the entire set of tasks from searching for the item, adding it to the shopping cart, paying for it, and receiving confirmation;</li>
						<li>Submitting tax information, from start to end of the process; and</li>
						<li>Interacting with other users in a virtual reality environment.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A process is comprised of one or more <a href="#views">views</a>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Types of tests</h3>
								
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests: <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a> and <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic tests</a>. Testing the outcomes using the atomic tests might involve a combination of <a>automated evaluation</a>, <a>semi-automated evaluation</a>, and <a>human evaluation</a>. <!--The content should be tested by those who understand how people with different types of disabilities use the technology being tested.--></p>
				
				<p>Although content may satisfy all outcomes using the atomic tests, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. The holistic tests address this gap by evaluating more of the user experience than atomic testing.</p>
				<p class="ednote">We are looking for more appropriate terms to distinguish between these two types of tests and welcome suggestions</p> 
					<section>
						<h4>Atomic tests</h4>
						<p>Atomic tests evaluate content, often at an <a>object</a> level, for accessibility. Atomic tests include the existing tests that support A, AA, and AAA <a>success criteria</a> in WCAG 2.X. They also include tests that may require additional context or expertise beyond tests that fit within the WCAG 2.X structure. In WCAG 3.0, atomic tests are used to test both processes and views. Test results are then aggregated across the selected views. Critical errors within selected processes are also totaled. Successful results of the atomic tests are used to reach a <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> rating.</p>
						<p>Atomic tests may be <a>automated</a> or <a>manual</a>. <a>Automated evaluation</a> can be completed without human assistance. These tests allow for a larger scope to be tested but automated evaluation alone cannot determine accessibility. Over time, the number of accessibility tests that can be automated is increasing, but manual testing is still required to evaluate most methods at this time.</p> 
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Holistic tests</h4>
						<p>Holistic tests include assistive technology testing, user-centered design methods, and both user and expert usability testing. Holistic testing applies to the entire declared scope and often uses the declared processes to guide the tests selected. Successful results of holistic tests are used to reach a <a href="#silver">silver</a> or <a href="#gold">gold</a> rating.</p>
						<p class="ednote">Future drafts will further explore holistic tests and provide examples as well as detail how to apply them.</p>
					</section>

				</section>
				<section>
				<h3>Technology specific testing</h3>				
				<p>Each outcome includes <a href="#methods-structure">methods</a> associated with different technologies. Each method contains <a>tests</a> and <a>techniques</a> for satisfying the outcome. The outcome is written so that testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies that do not have related methods based solely on the outcome.</p>
				</section>
				<p class="ednote">We continue to test this approach and others for validity, reliability, sensitivity, adequacy, and complexity.  Alternatives that we are exploring are noted as separate editor’s notes where applicable. We welcome suggestions on ways to improve the scoring to better meet these criteria.</p>

				<h2>Scoring</h2>

				<details class="summary">
					<summary>How are tests scored?</summary>
					<p>Besides true/false scoring methods, we’ve included testing options for new guidance, such as rating scales.</p>
					<p>Each outcome has a section that shows how it is scored.</p>
				</details>
				
				<p class="ednote">One of the goals of WCAG 3.0 is to expand scoring tests of methods beyond a binary true/false choice at the page level. We have included tests within the sample outcomes that demonstrate alternatives such as <a>rubrics</a> and <a>scales</a>. We are also exploring integrating these options into <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/">Accessibility Conformance Testing</a> format. We will include example tests in a future draft. Our intent is to include detailed <a href="https://w3c.github.io/silver/requirements/#multiple-ways-to-measure">tests for methods</a> to support each outcome within the WCAG 3.0 model.</p>
				<p>Each <a href="#outcomes"> outcome</a> has <a href="#methods-structure">methods</a> associated with different technologies. Each method contains <a>tests</a> and <a>techniques</a> for meeting that outcome. Testers can test the accessibility of new and emerging technologies that do not have related methods based on the outcome.</p>	
				<section>
				<h3>Scoring atomic tests</h3>
				<p>In most cases, testing individual <a>objects</a> will result in binary, pass / fail outcome for each element. This leads to either a pass / fail or a percentage rating depending on the test. A rating scale may be provided for some tests to allow the tester to assign a quality judgement of an element or block of content. Whether scoring is binary (pass/fail) or uses rating scales, will depend on the method, outcome, and technology. Binary scoring works well when the unit being tested has clear boundaries and pass/fail conditions.  Rating scales work better when the unit being tested does not have clear boundaries, when evaluating success requires a quality judgement, or when the test includes gradations of quality. Each of these results can be then be assigned a percentage or averaged to inform the overall score of an outcome.</p>
					<p>Test results for views:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tests that results in a pass or fail condition will be assigned a 100% or 0%;</li>
						<li>Tests at the element level that can be consistently counted will be assigned a percentage (number passed / total number of instances);</li>
						<li>Tests that apply to content without clear boundaries will be scored using a <a>rating scale</a>. The rating scales may vary based on the test and may be presented as numeric scale, an <a>adjectival rating</a> or a <a>rubric</a>. Each of these can be converted into a percentage to make it easier to compare across tests.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>In addition, <a>critical errors</a> within selected processes will be identified and totaled. Any critical errors will result in score of very poor (0).</p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Scoring outcomes</h3>
				<p>The results from the atomic tests are aggregated across views and used along with the number of critical errors to assign an <a>adjectival rating</a> to the outcome. Testers will then use the guidance provided in the outcome along with reasonable judgement of the context that the errors occur in to assign an accessibility score of the outcome.</p>
					<div class="example">
						<p>Potential thresholds for adjectival ratings of test results:</p>
					<dl>
					<dt>Very Poor (0)</dt>
					<dd>Any critical errors or less than 50% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Poor (1)</dt>
					<dd>No critical errors, <abbr title="approximately">approx.</abbr> 50% to 79% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Fair (2)</dt>
						<dd>No critical errors, approx. 80% to 89% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Good (3)</dt>
						<dd>No critical errors, approx. 90% to 98% of related tests pass</dd>
					<dt>Excellent (4)</dt>
						<dd>No critical errors, approx. 99% to 100% of related tests pass</dd>
				</dl>
						<div class="note"><p>The thresholds are different for different outcomes.</p>
				<p>These thresholds are still being tested and adjusted. These are included as examples to gather feedback on this scoring approach.</p>
			</div>
					</div>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				<h3>Overall scores</h3>
				<p>After all outcomes have been scored, the ratings are averaged for a total score and a score by the <a href="#functional-categories">functional category(ies)</a> they support. Conformance at the <a href="#bronze">bronze</a> level requires no critical errors and at least 3.5 total score and at least a 3.5 score within each functional category.</p>
				
				<p class="ednote">This approach, which allows the tester some flexibility in assigning scores, has the advantage of simplicity and allowing a tester to take the context into account beyond the simple percentages. The second option we are exploring is to carry percentages from tests through to a final score. In this case a bronze rating would require a total score of at least 90% and at least 90% within each functional need category. This number would likely shift as we continue testing.  We invite comment on these options as well as suggestions for an alternative solution.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Scoring holistic tests</h3>			
				<p>The points from <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic tests</a> do not affect the scores of <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a>. Rather a minimum number of holistic tests will need to be met in order to reach a <a href="#silver">silver</a> rating and additional holistic tests will be needed to reach a <a href="#gold">Gold</a> rating. Getting a silver or gold rating requires a Bronze rating.</p>
				<p class="ednote">We continue to work on the scoring of holistic tests and will provide more details in a future iteration of this document.</p>

			<h2>Guidelines</h2>
				<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>The following five guideline examples show different features of WCAG 3.0: </p>
					<ul><li>Text alternatives; </li>
					<li>Clear words;</li>
					<li>Captions;</li>
					<li>Structured content (headings); and</li>
					<li>Visual contrast of text (color contrast).</li>
					</ul>
			</details>
			<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including functional categories of disabilities, general guidelines, outcomes that can be tested, a rich collection of methods, resource links, and code samples.</p>
			
			<p>The guidelines included in this draft have been selected to show different types of content:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#text-alternatives">Text alternatives</a> - a direct migration from WCAG 2.X success criterion</li>
				<li><a href="#clear-words">Clear words</a> - new guidance that could not previously be included in WCAG 2.X. It is directly based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/"> Making content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities</a> [[coga-usable]].</li>
				<li><a href="#captions">Captions</a> - an example of adapting WCAG 2.X guidance to emerging technologies, such as web virtual reality</li>
				<li><a href="#structured-content">Structured content</a> - migration and merging of several previously unrelated WCAG 2.X success criteria</li>
				<li><a href="#visual-contrast-of-text">Visual contrast of text</a> - a migration of WCAG 2.X with substantial changes</li>
			</ul>
			
			<div class="ednote">
			<p>These are <strong>early drafts of guidelines included to serve as initial examples</strong>. They are used to illustrate what WCAG 3.0 could look like and to test the process of writing content. These guideline drafts should not be considered as final content of WCAG 3.0. They are included to show how the structure would work. As this draft matures, numbering of individual guidelines will be removed to improve overall usability of the guidelines in response to public requests. WCAG 2.x success criteria will be migrated to this new structure before WCAG 3.0 moves to candidate recommendation.</p>

			<p>As more content is developed, this section will be a list of guidelines with a unique short name, and the text of the requirement written in plain language. To see the overall plan for migrating content from WCAG 2.1 to WCAG 3.0, see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCRXrtmnSSTso-6S_IO9GQ3AKTB4FYt9k92eT_1PWX4/edit">WCAG to Silver Outline Map</a>.</p>

						<div class="ednote">
						 <p>We selected the Text Alternatives guideline to illustrate how WCAG 2.2 success criteria can be moved to WCAG 3.0 with minimal changes. Most of the material was directly copied from W3C sources such as WCAG 2.1, Web Accessibility Tutorials, and HTML 5.3 examples.</p>

						 <p>There are subtleties to the scoring of the methods that should be noted in this guideline. We have included four different methods for different types of images in HTML:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>functional images;</li>
								<li>informative images;</li> 
								<li>images of text; and</li>
								<li>decorative images. </li>
								</ul>
						  <p>The scoring is set up to work across all types of images to make it easier for automated tools. The automated tool does not need to know the type of image and can give you a score of the number of images and the number of images passed. The tester reviewing the path that a user would use to accomplish a task can identify whether the lack of a text alternative is a critical error that would stop a user from completing a task. This allows an automated tool to do the <q>heavy lifting</q> for identifying all the text alternatives while still allowing a knowledgeable tester to identify and evaluate the images that are necessary to complete a task. </p>

						  <p>This guideline also illustrates an example of critical errors along a path. Organizations with large numbers of images often have a missing text alternative on an image as a bug. They need to know when that missing text alternative is critical to be fixed, and when it is a lower priority. This critical error example shows how an image without alternative text that is crucial for completing the task gives a rating of zero. An image without alternative text that is not crucial, such as an image in the footer, does not block the organization from receiving the score the rest of the images deserve. This makes it possible for very large web sites or apps to be able to conform even if they have a low number of bugs without losing the critical needs of people with disabilities. </p>

						  <p>We are interested in your feedback on this approach to testing and scoring. Does this approach help large organizations conform even if their site is not 100% perfect? Do you think that organizations will interpret that they only need 95% of text alternatives for images and then stop adding alternative text?  Are the bands of numbers for the different ratings correct?  Do people with disabilities in particular feel that this approach will meet their needs? </p>  

						 <p>For this First Public Working Draft, we included HTML methods. This will be expanded in future drafts. We have also included a method, Author Control of Text Alternatives (ATAG),  that demonstrates how requirements from the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 can be included as methods. </p>

					<p>We selected Use Clear Words to show that the new WCAG3 structure can include accessibility guidance that does not fit into the WCAG 2.x structure.  In the research phase of this project, we identified user needs from the Cognitive Accessibility Task Force and the Low Vision Accessibility Task Force that could not be addressed by a true/false success criterion in WCAG 2.1.  We wanted to select one of those user needs and include it in the first draft of WCAG3 to show that more complex user needs can be included and still be testable and scored.   </p>

					<p>Use Clear Words is a new guideline proposed by the Cognitive Accessibility Task Force (COGA) and includes research, documents and comments from COGA. The selection of user needs and the outcomes necessary to address them is aligned with the new COGA publication, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/">Making content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities [coga-usable]</a>. </p>

					<p>The clear words guideline was included to illustrate that the proposed WCAG 3.0 scoring and structure can be used in non-binary testing. Clear words guideline uses a rating scale with flexible units of measure. For example, testing could be done by a webpage, a paragraph, a section of instructions on an application, or other. A manual tester evaluates the paragraph, webpage, or section on a rating scale. While we do not know of any mainstream accessibility tool that measures common words, there are some working prototypes of tools developed outside the W3C. We are interested in feedback on testing this guideline and its scoring.</p>

					<p>There are a number of exceptions to this guideline. We are interested in feedback where to put that information for ease of use.</p> 

					<p>This category of new guideline needs further development. It is included to show that it could work, not necessarily that this is the shape of the final guideline.</p>

						<p>This guideline demonstrates how the WCAG3 structure can be used with emerging technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality and other immersive web technologies (XR). Research in this area is ongoing and we expect to complete more details in future drafts. </p>

						<p>The Silver XR group has been working closely with other groups within the W3C as well as researchers in the area of captioning in immersive technologies. This is a rapidly developing field, and the recommendations listed are more exploratory. They are included as an example that WCAG3 can be used with emerging technologies. We hope that including this guideline will help inspire more research in this area.  </p>

						<p>Because this guideline was included to demonstrate emerging technology, there is little guidance included on traditional captions. Future drafts will also include more traditional caption guidance. </p>

						<p>We are looking for feedback on the scoring of captions. Media that is essential to accomplishing the task that does not have captions is a critical error and automatically fails (a 0 rating).  Examples include educational videos, entertainment site previews, or directions for installing a product.  Other videos without captions that are not essential to the task such as advertising and promotional videos that are not essential to shopping experience are not automatically failed, but the cumulative lack of captioning reduces the score.  We want feedback on this approach. </p>

						<p>We want public feedback about whether Open Captions (burned in captions) should be considered as equivalent to Closed Captions.  Closed captions are text that can be customized to meet user needs, for example, a hard of hearing person with low vision (like a lot of aging people). Open captions are burned in and cannot be customized. They can't be adapted to other languages. If closed captions are added, then they are overlaid on the Open Captions and hard to read. If we receive sufficient feedback to leave captions as they are today (both closed or open are equally acceptable), then we will use a simple scoring rating. If we decide to not accept open captions as equivalent to closed captions, then we will give more points to closed captions than open. </p>

						<p>Note that the advanced XR outcomes and metadata do not have critical errors.  This is a way that best practices can be included so that they are not punitive, but could give extra points that an organization who implements them could use to potentially raise their score.  We are interested in your feedback about this approach. </p>

					<p>We included the structured content guideline as an example of an “easy” guideline that was well understood and addressed diverse disability needs. While WCAG2 addresses headings from the semantic needs of screenreader users, little has been done to directly address the needs of people with cognitive disabilities around headings.  This guideline shows how a well-known area of accessibility can address more user needs of different groups of people with disabilities.  The structured content guideline has multiple outcomes working together to cover the different aspects of accessibility needed for different categories of people with disabilities. </p>

					<p>The structured content guideline began as a guideline on use of headings. Going through the content development process, we realized that it was a broader topic than simply headings, but there is little content developed beyond headings. Note that this guideline is used for prototyping, and is the most uneven in style of content.  Additional outcomes and content will be added in future drafts to make this guideline more complete.</p>

					<p>Structured content guideline also shows how several WCAG 2.1 success criteria can be re-combined and include AAA level success criteria such as 2.4.10 Section Headings.  The scoring shows how the rating can be improved by including all headings, but does not fail the lack of section headings, unless that section heading is essential to accomplishing a task. We think this will allow organizations to continually improve their use of headings without failing them for what was formerly required by an AAA success criterion.</p>   

					<p>We are looking for feedback on using scoring as a way to encourage adoption of AAA success criteria without failures.  Do you like the inclusion of broader needs for structured content than providing semantics for screenreader users? Do you think this should be a separate guideline, or do you like having multiple, testable outcomes supporting the guideline?  Do you like the approach of merging WCAG2 success criteria with related user needs?</p>

				<p>The proposed new guidance more accurately models current research in human visual perception of contrast and light intensity. The goal is to improve understanding of the functional needs of all users, and more effectively match the needs of those who face barriers accessing content. This new perception-based model is more context dependent than a strict light ratio measurement; results can, for example, vary with size of text and the darkness of the colors or background.</p>
				<p>This model is more responsive to user needs and allows designers more choice in visual presentation. It does this by including multi-factor assessment tests which integrate contrast with inter-related elements of visual readability, such as font features. It includes tests to determine an upper limit of contrast, where elevated contrast may impact usability.</p>

			<h2>Conformance</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>You might want to make a claim that your content or product meets the WCAG 3.0 outcomes. If it does meet the outcomes, we call this “conformance.” To conform to WCAG 3.0, your test results must show that your project is accessible.</p>
				<p>If you want to make a conformance claim, you must use the process described in this document. Your content can conform to WCAG 3.0, even if you don’t want to make a claim. You can still use this process to test your project’s accessibility.</p>	
		</details>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance levels</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
				<p>WCAG 3.0 includes a new conformance model in order to address a wider range of user needs, test a wider range of technologies and support new approaches to testing. There are several key goals for this new conformance model:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Develop a scoring model that encourages websites to continue to do better and better (vs. stopping at the previous AA level);</li>
					<li>Better reflect the lived experience of people with disabilities, who successfully use sites that have some content that does not meet WCAG 2.0 AA, or who encounter barriers with sites that meet WCAG 2.0 AA;</li>
					<li>Allow for bugs and oversight by content authors, provided the impact of them is limited to users with disabilities.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>To do this, the conformance model prioritizes content needed to complete tasks while still testing the entire view for accessibility errors.  This priority is reflected in the scoring system, which does not allow for errors along the paths needed to complete processes but allow for some accessibility errors outside process completion.  This means that sites may conform at the lowest level (Bronze), while still containing a small amount of content that does not meet one or more guidelines, so long as that content doesn’t prevent people with disabilities from successfully using the site.</p>

				<p>We seek feedback on whether this flexibility will be beneficial in encouraging content providers to meet conformance because it is more achievable or whether content providers are less likely to improve accessibility if they aren't required to. We also seek feedback on the conformance approach as a whole.</p>
				</div>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 defines three levels of conformance: <a href="#bronze">bronze</a>, <a href="#silver">silver</a>, and <a href="#gold">gold</a>.</p>

				<section>
					<h4>Bronze</h4>
					<p>Bronze is the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the bronze level does not conform to WCAG 3.0. The bronze level can be verified using <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a>. While there is a lot of overlap between WCAG 2.X and WCAG 3.0, WCAG 3 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics. As a result, WCAG 3.0 is not backwards compatible with WCAG 2.X.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the bronze level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The total score and score within each of the functional categories MUST be at least 3.5; and</li>
						<li><a>Views</a> and <a>processes</a> MUST NOT have <a>critical errors</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Conformance to this specification at the bronze level does not mean every requirement in every guideline is fully met. Bronze level means that the content in scope does have any critical errors and meets the minimum percentage of @@</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Silver</h4>
					<p>Silver is a higher conformance level that addresses additional outcomes. Some <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic testing</a> is necessary to verify conformance to this level.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the silver level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All <a>views</a> MUST satisfy the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> criteria; and</li>
						<li>Use of holistic tests to meet this level will be further explored in future drafts</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Gold</h4>
					<p>Gold is the highest conformance level that addresses the remaining outcomes described in the guidelines. Additional <a href="#holistic-tests">holistic testing</a> is necessary to verify conformance to this level.</p>
					<p>For content that conforms to the gold level:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All <a>views</a> MUST satisfy the <a href="#bronze">Bronze</a> criteria; and</li>
						<li>Use of holistic tests to meet this level will be further explored in future drafts</li>

				<h3>Conforming alternative version</h3>
				<p class="ednote">For this first draft, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has focused on the basic conformance model. For a next draft, we will explore how <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternative versions</a> fit into the new conformance model.</p>

				<h3>Only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies</h3>
				<p class="ednote">For this first draft, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has focused on the basic conformance model. For a next draft, we will explore how <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc4">accessibility-supported</a> fits into the new conformance model.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Defining conformance scope</h3>
				<p>When evaluating the accessibility of content, WCAG 3.0 requires the outcomes apply to a specific scope. While the scope can be an all content within a digital product, it is usually one or more sub-sets of the whole. Reasons for this include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Large amounts of content are impractical to evaluate comprehensively using anything beyond <a>automated evaluation</a> of <a href="#atomic-tests">atomic tests</a>;</li>
					<li>In many cases, content changes frequently, causing evaluation to be accurate only for a specific moment in time;</li>
					<li>Some content is more important to the majority of users than other content; and</li>
					<li>Content that mostly meets the requirements but has problems can interfere with the user's ability to complete a process begun elsewhere.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 therefore defines two inter-related ways to scope content: <a href="#views">views</a> and <a href="#processes">processes</a>. Evaluation is done on one or more complete views or processes, and conformance is determined on the basis of one or more complete views or processes. </p>

				<p>Conformance is defined only for <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one process and view, a series of processes and views, or multiple related processes and views.  All unique steps in a process MUST be represented in the set of views. Views outside of the process MAY also be included in the scope.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The AG WG and Silver Task Force recognize that representative sampling is an important strategy that large and complex sites use to assess accessibility. While it is not addressed within this document at this time, our intent is to later address it within this document or in a separate document before the guidelines reach the Candidate Recommendation stage. We welcome your suggestions and feedback about the best way to incorporate representative sampling in WCAG 3.0.</p>

				<h3>Conformance requirements</h3>
				<p>In order for technology to <a>conform</a> to WCAG 3.0, the following conformance requirements apply:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Conformance level</b> - Content MUST meet the requirements of the selected <a href="#conformance-levels">conformance level</a>.</li>
					<li><b>Processes and views</b> - Conformance (and conformance level) MUST apply to complete <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>, and MUST NOT exclude any part of a process or view.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Conformance claims</h3>
				<p>Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 3.0 without making a claim. The material below describes how to make a conformance claim if that option is chosen.</p>
				<section><h4>Required components of a conformance claim</h4><p>A conformance claim MUST include the following information:</p><ol>
						<li><b>Date</b> of the claim;</li>
						<li><b>Guidelines title, version and URI</b>
							<q>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 at ???</q></li>
						<li><b>Conformance level</b> satisfied: (bronze, silver, or gold);</li>
						<li><b>A concise description of the views and processes</b>, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including any state changes which lead to a new view; and</li>
						<li>The technology including the hardware, software, and assistive technology used to test the claim.</li>
						</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Example conformance claim</h4>
					<p>On 12 August 2020, the following 10 views and 2 processes conform to WCAG 3.0 at a bronze level. Processes were selected because they are the most common activities on the site and include 4 unique views. The other 6 views are the most commonly used.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Process 1: Order Newsletter (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, www.example.com/newsletter)</li>
						<li>Process 2: Comment on Blog Post (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a>, <a href="http://www.example.com/blog">www.example.com/blog</a> (with comment model open)</li>

			<h2>Differences from WCAG 2</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Outcomes are different from WCAG 2.X success criteria. Compared to success criteria, outcomes are written to be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In plain language; </li>
					<li>More understandable by people who are not experts in technology;</li>
					<li>More user-need oriented instead of technology oriented;</li>
					<li>More granular, so there will be more of them; and</li>
					<li>More flexible to allow more tests than the true/false statements of WCAG 2.X. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The design of outcomes allows more varied needs of people with disabilities than could have been included in WCAG 2.X. </p>
				<p>Methods map approximately to WCAG 2.X Techniques documents.</p>
