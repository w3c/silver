				<h2>Technical responsibilities</h2>
				<ul><li>Ensure that alternative text for images is added to all informational and functional images.</li> 
					<li>Use empty alternative text, alt="" for decorative images, or include them in the CSS instead.</li> 
					<li>Text alternatives are usually provided by those responsible for written content.</li>

				<h2>Technical tips</h2>
				<ul><li>If the image is not important for understanding the content — for example, it is just decoration or <q>eye candy</q> — it should be implemented so that assistive technology ignore it. One way to help determine if an image should have null alt is to ask yourself: If the image was removed, would the user still get all the information from the page?</li>
				<li>The alternative text does not need to include the words <q>button</q>, <q>link</q>, or <q>image of</q>. (Screen readers automatically provide that information.)</li>
				<li>If the image is sufficiently described in the text — for example, a simple diagram illustrating what's written in the web page text — it can have brief alt text such as <q>Diagram of work flow as describe above.</q></li>
				<li>In HTML (which is web page code, called markup), alt is an attribute of the image element, and other elements. (So <q>alt tag</q> is technically incorrect; the correct terminology is <q>alt attribute</q>, or you can say <q>alt text</q>.) It looks like this in markup: &gt; img alt="WAI logo" src="/wai/logo.png"&lt;</li>
