				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>The Clear words guideline uses research-based strategies to improve the experience of individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities. Clear words help create more accessible content. Writing and editing with clear words includes the following guidance:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>use common words;</li>
					<li>define uncommon words;</li>
					<li>use simple tense; </li>
					<li>use literal language;</li>
					<li>avoid double negatives;</li>
					<li>avoid nested clauses; and</li>
					<li>use appropriate diacritical marks (such as è, ñ, ç).</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			
			<section id="reason">
				<h2>Why</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Clear words benefit individuals who live with cognitive and learning disabilities, language impairments, memory impairments, and autism. </li>
					<li>People with language impairments often have a reduced vocabulary and learning new terms is a very slow difficult process. For other groups, such as people living with dementia, learning new terms is not realistic or possible. Using common words that they already know will make the content understandable and usable. </li>
					<li>Simple tense, literal language, and active voice make it clear for individuals who struggle to interpret implicit information. </li>
					<li>Clear words improves everyone's reading success and allows for a broader audience. </li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Who it helps</h2>
				<p>There are many types of disabilities that can make it harder to read. This includes a large range of cognitive and learning disabilities, mental health conditions, aging-related conditions, <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_disability">print disabilities</a>, and cognitive impacts of some chronic or other health conditions. It also helps people who are non-native language speakers. </p>
				<p>Not all individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities have the same needs. Difficulties with reading vary by disability but also by individual. It’s important not to make assumptions. Many people with disabilities can understand specialized or complex information, but can benefit from the same principles of clear words.</p>
				<p>Clear words generally help everyone. This is especially true for people who may have difficulty reading due to disability. Reading may also be more difficult when:
					<ul><li>tired</li><li>distracted/li><li>under stress/li><li>with low-literacy/li><li>when working outside one’s first language (such as with some sign language users), or /li><li>when vision is impaired./li><ul></p>
