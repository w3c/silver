				<li>If you’re writing and publishing your own content, you need to mark up any blocks of content in languages different from the language of the page. This might be achieved by using functionality in a text editor’s toolbar, or it might require directly editing code.</li>
				<li>If you’re writing content for others to publish, you need to highlight relevant changes of language so that the person who will be adding your content to a site knows how to mark it up.</li>

				<h2>How</h2>
				<p>Link to Style Guide or Pattern Library examples - visual and code, if available</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Highlight content using an application’s commenting or reviewing functionality. For example: in a document written in English with a block of content written in French, select the block of French content and add a comment saying “mark up as French”.</li>

				<h2>Editor Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Use a text editor that supports marking up or highlighting changes of languages.</li>
					<li>There isn’t a specific proofreader’s mark for marking up a change of language, but the s/b (“should be”) abbreviation followed by a comment such as “mark up as French” could be used.</li>
