			<p>Designers are not usually involved in a change of language when it is only a change from the default language for a quotation of some kind. That is usually between the editors or writers and the developers.</p>

				<h2>Doing more than the minimum</h2>
				<p>There is potential for more inclusive design. For example, a designer might add a feature to change the text‚Äôs language. For example, a French flag accompanying a locution fran√ßaise üá´üá∑. Or some other visible annotation. Or an adjacent ‚ÄúPronounce this out loud‚Äù button. This is not required, but goes beyond the minimum.</p>
				<p>In a complex site or product, there may be additional features that are associated with a language change that may involve design. Generally the control to select the language is part of the visual design. The ease of discovery and use are often part of the design activity.</p>
				<p>Language change controls, like all controls, need to conform to WCAG. For example, the color contrast must be sufficient for a person with color deficiency or low vision to be able to discover the control.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You must ensure that the control to change the language can be discovered and operated by a person with a disability. This means that the control will have to meet WCAG.</li>
					<li>Make the control easy to use, especially by a person with a motor disability. Language lists are often very long and difficult to select by a person with a tremor or limited motor skills.  Consider a search feature if the list of languages is long.  Going beyond the minimum could include taking advantage of a user‚Äôs language preferences from their browser settings so a multilingual user who is accustomed to switching languages frequently in web-authored content would see their preferred languages prioritized inside a control."</li>
