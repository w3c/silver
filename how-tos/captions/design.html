				<h2>Design responsibilities</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure that captions are in sync.</li>
					<li>Ensure the source of the caption, such as the speaker or other context is clear.</li>
					<li>Ensure sufficient colour contrast for captions.</li>
					<li>Captions can be resized without loss of legibility or clarity of context.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Designer tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>When designing a UI, consider how subtitles might be incorporated. For example, is <q>chrome</q> at the bottom of the viewport tall enough that two lines of text could fit in that location?  Could, when captioning is enabled, icons and statistics in a status bar be reduced in size to make room for subtitles?</li>
					<li>Use color to show the differences between captions that relate to different speakers or captioned / audio description. NOTE: The use of color variation to associate captions with particular speakers is useful in this context. Generally color alone should not be used to denote important information to the user.</li>
					<li>Be aware of occlusion with captioned content. </li>
				</ul>

				<h2>User testing and meaningful involvement</h2>
				<p>Captions were originally developed for people with hearing loss.  Today, studies show that 80% of people using captions do not have a hearing disability. Correctly captioning sound effects happening outside the userâ€™s point of view is audio description, which is usually provided for people who are blind.It is important to involve people with a variety of disabilities and hearing ability in captioning. Involving people with disabilities in the early stage of a project can provide valuable input from experts on what will be the best way to provide a service to a broad spectrum of users.</p>
