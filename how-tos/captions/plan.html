				<h3>For Content Development</h3>
				<p>The project team should consider the purpose of the content that is to be consumed using a given engine. Is this entertainment, informative, or educational? These aspects could affect which captioning features of the engine or type of action to be used. For example, an educational virtual environment would need to caption every character, with the ability to re-read captions or read a transcript. An entertainment virtual environment would want to limit excessive on-screen text that could detract from the users experience. A virtual reality game would need to inform the user of sounds behind where they currently are facing. The type of captioning selected is often an artistic decision.</p>

				<h3>For Engine Development</h3>
				<p>Ensure usability studies include a broad spectrum of captioning needs.  Include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>people who are deaf,</li>
					<li>people from the Deaf community (native sign language speakers),</li>
					<li>people who are hard of hearing,</li>
					<li>people with age-related hearing loss,</li>
					<li>people with auditory processing difficulty,</li>
					<li>people who prefer captioning,  and</li>
					<li>People who have situational lack of sound. </li>
				</ul>
