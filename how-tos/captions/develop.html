			<h2>Technical responsibilities</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Developers need to familiarize themselves with the native subtitling and captioning features of the
					platform for which they are developing.
					<ul>
						<li>As with other aspects of accessibility, compatibility is usually more important than
							providing features directly.</li>
						<li> However, the contrary position might be more relevant, as XR and VR remain on the leading
							edge of technology, it follows that captioning in these environments might also need to be
							ad hoc.</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li>In a similar vein, there are third-party APIs for streaming text. Compatibility with these is an
					important technical feature.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Technical tips</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Any non-player characters and avatars with speech dialog will have scripts. Have an option for
					exposing these scripts to the users/players. Speech-only dialog by voice actors will still have
					scripts, so retain the screenplay during development so that it does not have to be recreated
					post-production.</li>
				<li>Know that Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) is not a panacea.</li>
				<li>Learn what options for telephony based speech-to-text services are available in the geographic
					regions your products will be distributed. Provide features that facilitate use of these services.
				</li>
