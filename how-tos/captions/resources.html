			<p>Very few resources exist to assist in creating captions for XR environments. This is, in part, due to the emerging nature of this field and the lack of a common ground between developers. We, therefore, leave this how-to resource section blank at this stage.</p>
			<p>That said, the following resources serve as examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Immersive caption community group, led by Christopher Patnoe, have created a number of demonstrations of captioning methods that can be used in XR. Information on their work can be found at <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/immersive-captions/">https://www.w3.org/community/immersive-captions/</a>
				</li>
				<li>BBC R&amp;D have conducted exploratory work in how subtitles can be placed in 360 video, with this looking at a number of different options (evenly spaced, follow head, follow with lag, appear in front). A summary of their work is available at <a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP330.pdf">http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP330.pdf</a></li>
				<li>Vacation Simulator is a popular game that is available for the Oculus Quest VR headset. A recent update to this game brought in-game subtitles. Information on the presentation of these can be seen at <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/see-what-we-said-vacation-simulator-subtitles-update-and-language-support/?locale=en_GB">https://www.oculus.com/blog/see-what-we-said-vacation-simulator-subtitles-update-and-language-support/?locale=en_GB</a></li>
