				<h2>Design responsibilities</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Ensure your product content is structurally organized.</li>
					<li>The visual styling of the different heading levels also helps to organize the content.</li>
					<li>Visual styling needs to be coded semantically, that is, the code communicates the level of the headings to non-visual users. This can be a shared responsibility with developers.  However if the design team <q>owns</q> the CSS, that could force a developer to use a non-semantic code element to get the appearance the designer has specified.</li>
					<li>Coordinate with SEO teams to balance heading requirements against the search ranking component afforded by headings</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Designer tips</h2>
				<p>Design the headings in the same font and consistent color scheme with descending font sizes based on the heading level. Making sure the font sizes and colors align with the overall design of the website is essential to bringing consistency and cohesion to the design.</p>

				<h2>User testing and meaningful involvement</h2>
			</section>
			<ul>
				<li>Can the user perceive the different content sections delineated by headings if they are using assistive technology and cannot see the headings? </li>
				<li>Ask a user to find a specific piece of content by only reviewing a list of headings. </li>
				<li>Can the understand the different content sections delineated by headings? </li>
				<li>Can the user move to a heading deeper in the content hierarchy without waiting for the content from an earlier heading to announce? </li>
