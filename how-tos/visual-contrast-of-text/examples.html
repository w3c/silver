			<p class="note">The examples over black or white are the font Montserrat at 16px normal (400 weight). The examples over yellow are 18px 200 weight, except the large text which is 32px bold. CSS font-smoothing is at default (auto). The last example is 18px and 300 weight, and shows the difference with font smoothing if supported by this browser.</p>
			
			<p>Notice that the pure blue over black is very difficult to read. To use blue as the brightest of two colors, green must be added. Similarly, full green is hard to read against white, this is because green makes up the majority of luminance, or lightness.</p>

				<h3>Black background</h3>
				<div class="testBox">
					<p>#00F <span style="color: #00F;">This is Maximum Blue on Black. Difficult to Read. ☆ ★ ◯ ♥ ☎ </span></p>
					<p>#08F <span style="color: #08F;">Add some green for a readable blue against black. ☆ ★ ◯ ♥ ☎</span></p>
					<p>#F00 <span style="color: #F00; ">This is Pure Red on Black, approximately -80% contrast. Some types of color vision problems cause the red to be ~35% darker (on sRGB) thus pure red is better as the darkest of two colors. ☆ ★ ◯ ♥ ☎</span></p>
					<p>#0A0 <span style="color: #0A0;">This is Green on Black at -80% contrast. ☆ ★ ◯ ♥ ☎</span></p>

				<h3>White background</h3>
				<div class="testBoxWhite">
					<p>#0F0 <span style="color: #0F0;">This is Maximum Green on White. Difficult to Read. ☆ ★ ◯ ♥ ☎</span></p>
					<p>#080 <span style="color: #080;">Keep green less than #080 for readability against white. ☆ ★ ◯ ♥ ☎</span></p>
					<p>#E00 <span style="color: #E00; ">This is Pure Red on White, approximately 80% contrast. Since some color vision problems cause the red to be ~35% darker (on sRGB) pure red can be okay as the darker color against white. ☆ ★ ◯ ♥ ☎</span></p>
					<p>#00F <span style="color: #00F;">Full Blue on White is 110% contrast. Since the blue is the same value in the white background, there is no detail in the blue channel at all. This is advantageous as it can reduce glare and chromatic aberration. ☆ ★ ◯ ♥ ☎</span></p>

				<h3>Yellow background</h3>
				<div class="testBoxBeige thinFont" style="">
					<p><span style="color: #504;">This is Blue #009 very thin text on a #FE9 BG (120%). ☆ ★ ◯</span></p>
					<p><span style="color: #504;">This is #504 dark purple thin text (120% contrast on #FE9). ☆ ★ ◯</span></p>
					<p><span style="color: #79F;">#79F (50% contrast on #FE9) is too light for small thin text,  ☆ ★ ◯</span></p>
					<p><span style="color: #79F; font-size: 32px; font-weight: 700;">but #79F is okay for large bold text.</span></p>
