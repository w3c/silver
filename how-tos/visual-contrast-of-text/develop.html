				<h2>Technical tips</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Javascript, PHP, and other dynamic page scripts must maintain the proper contrast and weight and size ratios.</li>
					<li>Ensure Javascript and other dynamic page scripts allow text to be scaled in size without breaking content, so that:
						<ul><li>User can scale the smallest content text five times larger on a full sized desktop screen without breaking content nor requiring horizontal scrolling for any single text element or text block.</li>
							<li>User can scale the smallest content text two times larger on a mobile device without breaking content nor requiring horizontal scrolling for any single text element or text block.</li>
							<li>User can scale the smallest content text five times larger on a mobile device without breaking content but horizontal scrolling is permitted in this use case.</li>
							<li>For all of the above, larger text does not have to increase by the scale amount, provided it remains larger than the smaller text that is scaled up.</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li>Ensure CSS style sheets, and inline styles do not use artificial font smoothing, and smoothing remains at default or <q>auto.</q></li>
					<li>The sRGB colorspace is the standard for web content, and the standard for accessibility. This should be the default colorspace, and any other colorspaces should be a selectable user option.</li>
					<li>The designer's workspace is important. Variations in monitor calibration and ambient lighting will affect the final output, often in unexpected ways.
						<ul><li>Use a hardware calibrator such as an XRite Display, and use software to calibrate the monitor to the sRGB standard.</li>
							<li>The ambient room lighting should be about 20% of the brightness of the monitor at peak white. For a monitor with a peak white of 160 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, the ambient should be around 64 lux.</li>
							<li>Put another way, setting the full screen to sRGB mid grey color #808080, the monitor should appear around the same brightness as the <q>overall</q> room lighting.</li>
							<li>The color temperature of the room lighting should be 5500K, ideally with a CRI over 90.</li>
							<li>Don't paint the walls 18% grey. Instead, paint the walls pure white and set the lighting level so the white walls approximate the monitor at #808080 grey.</li>
							<li>And finally, avoid bright colors in the field of vision when looking at a monitor. Nearby colors can affect how you perceive the monitor content.</li>
						</ul></li></ol>
