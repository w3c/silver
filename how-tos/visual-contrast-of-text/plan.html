				<h2>Planning responsibilities</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Because perceived contrast, and therefore readability, is tightly connected to font weight and font size. it is important to plan your CSS styles to provide predictable and consistent size and weight for the target display(s).
						<ul><li>This is particularly important for responsive designs that resize or reconfigure to different device resolutions.</li>
							<li>While designers are free to use any size units such as em, vw, calc(), etc., it is important for the calculated sizes as rendered meet or exceed the size values listed as px in the visual contrast chart.</li>
							<li>For non-standard fonts, compare the relative x height to the x height of a standard reference font, and adjust the font-size value for a match.</li>			
						</ul></li>
					<li>The design of each font also plays a significant part in readability and perceived contrast. When planning, selected fonts should be compared against the <q>standardized</q> fonts in the visual contrast matrix.</li>
					<li>The available useable colors to achieve readable visual contrast is largely constrained by font weight &amp; font size. Alternately if a specific color palette is required, the color palette may limit the minimum font weight &amp; size.</li>
					<li>The needs of font weight, size, and color extends to readable text content in images.
						<ul><li>The colorspace standard for web content is sRGB. Images with other profiles may give unpredictable results.</li>
							<li>Plan to get images early in the design process so they can be evaluated and adjusted if needed</li>
							<li>A suggested best practice is to use textless versions of images and  CSS compositing techniques to apply dynamic text over the image.</li>
						</ul></li>

				<h2>Tips for collaboration</h2>
				<p>The planning and design phases will often be very interactive, and it is important to maintain communication and understanding of the available range of colors, sizes, and weights early in the process to allow adjustments to meet design goals and client needs.</p>

			<section id="stages">
				<h2>Planning for each stage</h2>
				
				<p>Consider early design <q>wireframes</q> and the space allocated for various elements, and how this will affect the desired font size in the final design.</p>
				<p>Determine early on if the site will be responsive, to dynamically adjust and work on all device sizes, or if it will use a <q>mobile separate</q> paradigm. This choice will significantly affect font weight &amp; size.</p>
				<p>To simplify early planning, remember that smaller and thinner (light weight) fonts require greater contrast between the font color and the background. Conversely, a lower contrast can be used with larger and thicker fonts.</p>
