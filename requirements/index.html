			<p>Requirements for Silver document is the next phase in the development of the next major upgrade to accessibility guidelines that will be the successor to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 series. The Silver Task Force of the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the W3C Silver Community group have partnered to do incubate the needs, requirements, and structure for the new accessibility guidance. The group  planned research to study the needs, developed problem statements, received input from industry leaders for directions to procede, and have drafted these high-level requirements for the next phase of the project, the prototyping and public input. </p>

			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>People with disabilities can face problems using online content and   applications. Disabilities can be permanent, temporary, or situational   limitations. </p>
            <p>We need guidelines to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>identify these barriers encountered by people with disabilities. </li>
              <li>explain how to solve the problems they pose. </li>
            </ul>

		  <h2 id="problem_statements">Problem Statements</h2>
          <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 were designed to be   technology neutral, and have stayed relevant for over 10 years.  During   the year of Silver research, a recurring theme was the popularity and quality of the   guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the problem areas identified in the research were   improvements in the structure and presentation of WCAG 2.0 for usability, to support more disability needs, and to improve maintence. Research also included the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 and User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0. </p>
          <p>The   Problem Statements describe areas identified during the Silver research in   2017-2018 that  need to be addressed in the new guidelines. Each name links to the full text of the problem statement in the Silver wiki. </p>

		  <h2 id="design_principles">Design Principles</h2>
          <p>Accessibility guidelines should:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Support the needs of the widest possible range of people with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Support measuring changes in the level of conformance.</li>
            <li> Be flexible enough to support the needs of people with disabilities  using emerging technologies. </li>
            <li> Be usable and accessible.</li>
            <li>Be written in plain language, as easy as possible to understand.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The development process for the guidelines should</p>
          <ol start="6">
            <li> include people with disabilities,</li>
            <li>have global participation and feedback. </li>
            <li> Be about and for people – technology is important but secondary. </li>
            <li> Strive to be data informed and evidence based. </li>
            <li> Include the principles and intent of previous guidelines</li>
          </ol>
		</section>
		<section>
		  <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
          <p>Previous W3C Accessibility Guidelines described how to make web    pages accessible to people with disabilities. Those guidelines provided a     flexible framework that has kept the guidelines relevant for as many   as   10 years, but changing technology and needs of people with   disabilities   has shown areas where they could be improved. The   requirements are   drawn from the research performed by Silver to   improve the guidelines,   and the suggestions from the Silver Design   Sprint. These requirements   are high level, and will be expanded and   refined as Silver members move   through the prototyping process. </p>
          <p>These requirements will be refined in Q3 of 2018 at the end of the     prototyping process and in 2019 after public input from the First Public     Working Draft. </p>
          <ol>
            <li> Provide more information than a simple pass/fail statement. For    example, it may describe "minimal" and "better" methods of conforming to    a requirement. </li>
            <li> Create a structure for guidelines that can better meet the needs   of  people with disabilities in unanticipated technologies and   interactions.   The structure is flexible and forgiving of unanticipated   needs. </li>
            <li> Make the guidelines available in different accessible and usable  ways. </li>
          </ol>

	    <h2>Change Log</h2>
          <section>
            <h3 id="changes-before-the-first-public-working-draft">Changes Prior to First Public Working Draft</h3>
            <ul>
           	    <li>Added statement to Problem Statements about ATAG &amp; UAAG research. Minor grammar fixes. </li>
           	    <li>Add explanatory sentence to Problem Statement intro paragraph   about positive feedback on WCAG guidance and emphasis on structural and   presentation improvements.</li>
                    <li>Fix typo, change "situational disabilities" to "situational limitations"</li>
                    <li>Add short sentences on the timeline for updating the Requirements     document based on meeting of Cooper, Lauriat and Spellman of 23 March     2018. </li>
                    <li>Reorder the sections so that the background is first, folowed by Design Principles, then Requirements</li>
                    <li>Clarify the broader definition of "disabilities" based on input     from public comments and group discussion. The definition sentence in     the Introduction paragraph is a proposal for group discussion. </li>
                    <li>Insert missing word "people" from Design Principle #1 </li>
                    <li>Change "future" to "unanticipated" in Requirements #2 and add subsequent sentence. </li>
                    <li>Change the Requirements Intro paragraph to remove the specific     sentence on conformance and pass/fail tests and give greater context on     the source of the Requirements.        </li>
            </ul>
