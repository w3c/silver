			<p>The Requirements for W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 documentation is the next phase of development of the next major upgrade to accessibility guidelines. WCAG 3.0 will be the successor to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 series. The Silver Task Force of the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the W3C Silver Community group have partnered to incubate the needs, requirements, and structure for the new accessibility guidance. To date, the group  has: </p>
			<ol>
			  <li>Researched accessibility guidance needs.</li>
			  <li>Developed problem statements and opportunities to improve accessibility guidance.</li>
			  <li>Received input from industry leaders for directions to proceed.</li>
			  <li>Drafted these high-level requirements for the next phase of the project, the prototyping and public input. </li>
          </ol>
    </section>
		<section id="sotd">
			<p>The Requirements for WCAG 3.0 is published as a joint effort of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Main_Page">Silver Task Force</a> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a> and of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/">W3C Silver Community Group</a>. It is a work in progress, and comments are welcome as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/issues">Github Issues</a> or by <a href="mailto:public-silver@w3.org?subject=Comment%20Requirements%20for%20Silver">email to public-silver@w3.org</a>.</p>
			<p>This is the second phase of the Requirements developed during Q1 2019 after months of prototyping work. We anticipate one additional phase in Q3-Q4 2019 after months of evaluating how well actual content can be developed for WCAG 3.0.  </p>

		<section>
			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
			<p>People with disabilities can face problems using online content and applications. Disabilities can be permanent, temporary, or recurring limitations. </p>
			<p>We need guidance that: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>identifies the barriers encountered by people with disabilities,</li>
				<li>explains what causes these barriers and who they impact, and</li>
				<li>suggests how the problems they pose can be solved.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 was designed to be technology neutral, and has stayed relevant for over 10 years. Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 has been implemented in the open source authoring tool communities (chiefly Wordpress and Drupal) with little known uptake in commercial authoring tools. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0 offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis. There is no known user agent that has implemented all of UAAG 2.0. </p>
			<section>
				<h3>Comparison to WCAG 2.x Requirements</h3>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 builds on the<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/"> WCAG 2.0 Requirements of 2006</a>. The WCAG 2.0 requirements are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Ensure that requirements may be applied across technologies.</li>
					<li>Ensure that the conformance requirements are clear.</li>
					<li>Design deliverables with ease of use in mind.</li>
					<li>Write to a more diverse audience.</li>
					<li>Clearly identify who benefits from accessible content.</li>
					<li>Ensure that the revision is "backwards and forward compatible".</li>
				</ol>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 wishes to advance the WCAG 2.0 Requirements of:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>applied across technologies,</li>
					<li>clear conformance,</li>
					<li>ease of use,</li>
					<li>diverse audience, and</li>
					<li>identify who benefits.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 does not want to advance the WCAG 2.0 requirement: &quot;Ensure that the revision is 'backwards and forward compatible'&quot; . The intention is to include WCAG 2.x content, but migrate it to a different structure and conformance model. </p>
				<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/wcag21/requirements/">WCAG 2.1 Requirements</a> are very specific to WCAG 2.1 and will <em>not</em> be advanced by WCAG 3.0. WCAG 3.0 plans to migrate the content of WCAG 2.1 to WCAG 3.0, but the WCAG 2.1 Requirements document referred to structural requirements which are specific to WCAG 2.x. </p>
				<p>The WCAG 2.1 Requirements are: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Define a clear conformance model for WCAG 2.1/dot.x releases.</li>
					<li>Ensure the conformance structure utilizes the WCAG 2.0 A / AA / AAA model. </li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>WCAG 3.0 Scope</h3>
				<p>WCAG 3.0 will have a broader scope than WCAG 2.0 and 2.1. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are scoped to Web and to Content. WCAG 3.0 is being designed to be able to include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Disability Needs</strong>: An improved measurement and conformance structure that includes guidance for a broad range of disabilities. This includes particular attention to the needs of low vision and cognitive accessibility, whose needs don't tend to fit the true/false statement success criteria of WCAG 2.x.</li>
					<li><strong>Emerging Technologies</strong>: Flexibility to include emerging technologies, such as augmented/virtual reality(AR/VR/XR) and voice assistants</li>
					<li><strong>Support for the Technologies that Impact Accessibility</strong>: Advice for all levels of the accessibility technology stack who wish to support the WCAG 3.0 core Guidelines including: <ul>
						<li><strong>digital content</strong>, including guidance currently addressed by WCAG 2.x;</li>
						<li><strong>authoring tools</strong>, such as content management systems;</li>
						<li><strong>user agents</strong>, such as browsers and media players;</li>
						<li><strong>assistive technologies</strong>, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, and assistants for memory, organization, or simplification;</li>
						<li><strong>software and web applications</strong>, including mobile apps; and</li>
						<li><strong>operating systems</strong> and other platforms who may want advice for features to better support people with disabilities.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The current project design does not intend to write separate specifications or normative requirements for the technology stack beyond digital content. The goal is to provide information that technology venders can choose to use to improve the accessibility of their products to support the guidelines. </p>

				<h3>Silver Task Force Research</h3>
				<p class="ednote">Introductory text about the research efforts undertaken, with pointers to methodology and results</p>
				<p>The research done in 2017-2018 by the Silver Task Force, the Silver Community Group, and the <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/silver/master/prototypes/ConformancePrototype/index.html#research-partners">research partners</a> was used to identify the key problem statements related to the current accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.x, ATAG 2.0 and UAAG 2.0). See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1POs7orJ4ALB0bq5_vyo4v8RxDcr-5ctwD1noVgpXuJc/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0">Silver Research Summary slides</a> for more detailed information. These problem statements were used to identify the opportunities for WCAG 3.0 to address that will improve accessibility guidance. </p>
				<p>A recurring theme identified in the year of WCAG 3.0 research was the popularity and quality of the WCAG 2.0 guidance. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were improvements in the structure and presentation of accessibility guidance to improve usability, support more disability needs, and improve maintenance. </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Large and Dynamic Sites</h3>
				<p>In addition to the above research, an issue was raised about how to apply accessibility evaluation and conformance to large and dynamic web sites which are updated frequently. This led to development of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accessibility-conformance-challenges/">Challenges with Accessibility Guidelines Conformance and Testing, and Approaches for Mitigating Them</a>. Suggestions in that document are an additional source of input to these requirements.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Design Principles and Requirements</h3>
				<p>This document has two sections: a Design Principles section and a Requirements section. Requirements need to be measured or clearly demonstrated. They are used at the W3C phase of Candidate Recommendation, where the Candidate Recommendation Transition Request reports that the requirements were met. Design Principles are important statements that are less measurable, but are used to guide, shape and steer decision-making during the development process of WCAG 3.0. Both are essential in guiding the development of the WCAG 3.0 project. </p>

				<h3 id="problem_statements">Opportunities for WCAG 3.0 </h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Problem_Statements#Too_Difficult_to_Read">Problem Statements</a> describe areas identified during the WCAG 3.0 research in 2017-2018 that can be addressed in the new guidelines. Each problem statement also has an opportunity section that is the basis for the WCAG 3.0 Requirements. </p>
				<section id="oppotunities_usability">
					<h4>Usability</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Readable</strong>: When guidelines are easier to read and understand, users – especially people in the development cycle who are less technical – are more likely to implement accessibility. When all audiences are considered in the language and terminology used in the guidelines, the likelihood increases that they will: <ul>
								<li>reach a larger audience,</li>
								<li>be better understood,</li>
								<li>be easier to translate, and</li>
								<li>be interpreted as easier to implement.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>On-ramp for Beginners</strong>: When beginning users can develop understanding and mastery of the accessibility guidance, this leads to faster and greater acceptance of accessibility. This also creates the opportunity to convince developers and project managers to include accessibility at the beginning of a project instead of the end. </li>
						<li><strong> Current and Future Technology Oriented</strong>: Eliminating underlying assumptions and structure that are oriented toward the historic static web and improving guidance for modern web applications can increase acceptance by developers and provide greater accessibility of web and native applications. </li>
						<li><strong>Advocacy Tool</strong>: Usability oriented toward a broad audience for WCAG 3.0 can help improve the general advocacy of digital accessibility. Improving the reach of WCAG 3.0 can help improve the awareness of accessibility considerations. Compelling information that is contextually relevant to the standards may also aid in convincing audiences of any type. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="opportunities_conformance">
					<h4>Conformance Model</h4>
					<p>There are several areas for exploration in how conformance can work. These opportunities may or may not be incorporated. They need to work together, and that interplay will be governed by the design principles</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Measurable Guidance</strong>: Certain accessibility guidance is best expressed as a true/false statement. Others far less so. There are needs of people with disabilities, especially cognitive and low vision disabilities, that are better captured by a different type of measurement. WCAG 3.0 can include guidance (provisions) that use different means of evaluation beyond just true/false performance or outcome statements, allowing for the inclusion of more accessibility guidance.</li>
						<li><strong>Scope Options</strong>: WCAG 3.0 conformance could include web pages, web sites, page sections, individual components, and conformance based on a set of tasks as defined by the author of the site or application. A task-based assessment would allow flexibility for conformance of complex applications that go beyond component/tag assessment or full-page assessment.</li>
						<li><strong>Accessibility Supported</strong>: As the technologies advance, the lines between content, user agents, and assistive technology will continue to shift and blur. Interoperability may be affected by any number of factors outside of the control of the author and publisher of digital content. WCAG 3.0 can include advice to user agents and assistive technology developers. WCAG 3 does not intend to make authors responsible for interoperability problems beyond a reasonable effort.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="opportunities_maintenance">
					<h4>Maintenance</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Flexibility</strong>: A flexible structure enables greater scaling of new methods to meet guidelines. It also allows for the expiration of outdated methods to meet guidelines. A flexible process of updating methods enables the overall guidance to keep pace with technology. Flexible participation – particularly of people with disabilities – empowers a community and enables more inclusive insights.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Scaling</strong>: We intend WCAG 3.0 to apply to multiple contexts and multiple use cases. WCAG 3.0 intends to be iterative, future-friendly, and user-centric. </li>
						<li><strong>Evolving Technology</strong>: WCAG 3.0 needs a flexible design that can be updated as new technologies emerge, assistive technologies improve, and changing technologies produce new barriers for people with disabilities. Accessibility guidance and all supporting documentation should anticipate common scenarios like new technology and the introduction of new modalities like surface reaction and ultrahaptics. As content technology evolves, it must be re-evaluated against assistive technology for compatibility. Likewise, as assistive technology evolves or emerges, it must be evaluated against the backward compatibility of various content technology.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Governance</strong>: Utilize tools that allow interested parties to predict when issues important to them are being discussed. Maintain a backlog that reflects issues along with their status. </li>
						<li>
							<strong>Backwards compatibility</strong> The WCAG 3 guidelines will take a cautious approach to backwards compatibility to early versions of WCAG 3.  After the first publication of WCAG 3 guidance and conformance model the guidelines aim to be backwards compatible. However, it will not be bound to backwards compatibility if a substantially more accessible outcome can be achieved. Where there are backwards-incompatible changes, the changes will be highlighted in the supplementary materials so that users of the guidelines know exactly what has changed.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="opportunities_issue-severity">
					<h4>Issue Severity</h4>

					<div class="ednote">
						<p>This section is exploratory. Outstanding questions that need to be addressed include:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>What to do with non-critical issues?</li>
							<li>How to deal with people having have different ideas on what is critical?</li>
							<li>How do we incorporate context/process/task? Is that part of scoping, or issue severity? Both are important to the end result.</li>
							<li>Can the matrix inform designation of functional categories? For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2021/outcomes/text-alternative-available">Text Alternative Available outcome</a>.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>

					<p>The Issue Severity Subgroup:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Demonstrated that it is possible to categorize tests by severity. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MEdnI4CvrTlq1843MZfWLaIBGmoGXXQPpUOhEY1NgV4/edit#gid=412502721">critical severity worksheet</a> for this information.</li>
						<li>Added examples of critical failures to the tests for <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2022/methods/functional-images/#tests-button">Text Alternative Available</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2022/methods/text-equiv/#tests-button">Translates Speech And Non-Speech Audio</a>.</li>
						<li>Severity rating is best done at the test level. The higher the level the impact is assessed at, the less it aligns with the experience.</li>
						<li>It would be best to incorporate task/context for the best alignment. This does depend on scoping and how to define the task/process.</li>
						<li>It will be a lot of work to categorize each test with an impact level and the functional needs affected. It maybe best to focus on the critical issues. It would also be best to do the categorization as we go along, when creating tests.</li>
						<li>Severity rating could contribute towards scoring, but there are many other questions to do with scoring.</li>
						<li>Severity rating could also contribute towards prioritization, which could replace A/AA/AAA (at the test level)</li>
					</ol>

					<div class="note">
						<h5>Proposed updates</h5>

						<ul>
							<li>For the process of creating this: focus on critical issues. Don't try to rate high / medium / low.</li>
							<li>Use the critical severity matrix to categorize tests. (At least set up that process to define each test by functional need and impact).</li>
							<li>We could use Critical / High for a level of conformance. For example:
								<ul>
									<li>"Bronze" could be an absence of any critical or high issues;</li>
									<li>"Silver" could be an absence of any critical, high, or medium issues.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>We could use the severity scales as input to a post-testing process where you prioritize issues based on your context and tasks.</li>
						</ul>

		  <h2 id="design_principles">Design Principles</h2>
          <p>The WCAG 3.0 Design Principles are based on the requirements of WCAG 2.0 and build on those requirements to meet needs identified in the WCAG 3.0 research. </p>
          <p>Accessibility guidelines should:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Support the needs of a wide range of people with disabilities and recognize that people have individual and multiple needs.</li>
            <li>Support a measurement and conformance structure that includes guidance for a broad range of disabilities. This includes particular attention to the needs of low vision and cognitive accessibility, whose needs don't tend to fit the true/false statement success criteria of WCAG 2.x.</li>
            <li>Be flexible enough to support the needs of people with disabilities and keep up with emerging technologies. The information structure allows guidance to be added or removed.</li>
            <li>Be accessible and conform to the Guidelines. <span class="ednote">Note: This design principle will move to the Requirements section once the Conformance section is completed and we determine a specific measurement of compliance. </span></li>
            <li>Be written in plain language, as easy as possible to understand. <span class="ednote"> We need a definition of plain language that includes the ease of translation. Ideally, it will be a broadly accepted definition internationally. </span></li>
			<li>Improve the ability to support automated testing where appropriate and provide a procedure for repeatable tests when manual testing is appropriate.</li>
			<li>Provide requirements to address functional needs, while avoiding or minimizing negative impacts on other functional needs. </li>
			<li>Include accompanying documents that provide clear, concise, and findable technical information quickly in one place.</li>
			<li>Include, where possible and appropriate, links to instruction videos, illustrations, and how-to guides. Creation of new videos and illustrations are outside the scope of the working group at this time.</li>
			<li>Normative requirements should be unambiguous so there is only one possible meaning for each requirement.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The creation process for the guidelines should:</p>
          <ol start="7">
            <li>Actively recruit a diverse range of people with disabilities in recognition of the importance of their contributions to accessibility standards and solutions. Review and monitor whether people are included. Continually evaluate inclusive features of available tooling and procedures. </li>
            <li>Facilitate global participation and feedback.</li>
            <li>Be data-informed and evidence-based where possible.  We recognize that research and evidence are influenced by the number of people with a particular disability, by the size of the body of research, and by the difficulty in capturing data regarding some disabilities or combination of disabilities.  The intent is to make informed decisions wherever possible to ensure that the needs of all people with disabilities are prioritized, including needs that differ from the majority. In situations where there is no evidence or research, valid data-gathering methods should be used to obtain and evaluate information from advocacy groups, people with lived experience and other subject matter experts.</li>
			<li>Be written so the Guideline content is usable in adaptable and customizable ways. For example, WCAG 3.0 content is available to be extracted by users to adapt to their needs. </li>			
          </ol>
</section>
		<section>
		  <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
          <p>Previous W3C Accessibility Guidelines described how to make web    pages accessible to people with disabilities. These guidelines provided a     flexible framework that has kept the guidelines relevant for   10 years. Changing technology and changing needs of people with   disabilities   has shown areas where they could be improved. The   requirements are   drawn from the research performed by WCAG 3.0 to   improve the guidelines,   and the suggestions from the Silver Design  Sprint. </p>
          <p>The WCAG 3.0 Requirements are high level and will be expanded and refined as Silver members move through the prototyping process.</p>
          <section>
          <h3>Broad disability support</h3>
          <p>The guidance includes requirements that are not available in WCAG 2.x. Some guidance may use true/false verification but other guidance will use other ways of measuring and/or evaluating where appropriate so that more needs of people with disabilities may be included (for example: rubrics, sliding scale, task-completion, user research with people with disabilities, and more). This approach includes particular attention to people whose needs may better be met with a broad testing strategy, such as people with low vision, limited vision, or cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
          <h3>Flexible maintenance and extensibility</h3>
            <p>The informative documentation uses a process that is easy to update and maintain.
			The process of developing the guidance includes experts who review the guidelines to check they will work for emerging technologies and interactions.</p>
            </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Multiple ways to display</h3>
            <p>The Guidelines can be presented in different accessible and usable ways or formats, to address the needs of different audiences.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Technology Neutral</h3>
	    <p>Guidance is expressed in technology-neutral terms so that it can be met using different platforms or technologies. The intent of technology-neutral wording is to provide the opportunity to apply the core guidelines to current and emerging technology, even if specific technical advice doesn't yet exist.</p>
	 </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Readability</h3>
            <p>Requirements in WCAG 3 for plain language shall be applied to WCAG 3. It is desirable for the guidelines to be understandable by the widest possible audience.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Regulatory Environment</h3>
	    <p>Requirements are written to facilitate adoption into law, regulation, or policy, since this has been shown to have major impact on practice. This includes:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>making the need and purpose for the requirement clear, and</li>
	      <li>a clear definition of when requirements are met.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
	    <p>The Guidelines motivate organizations to go beyond minimal accessibility requirements with a conformance model that shows which organizations demonstrate a greater effort to improve accessibility</p>
	 </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
	    <p>WCAG 3 will provide guidance and a conformance model suitable for people and organizations that produce digital assets and technology of varying size and complexity. This includes large, dynamic, and complex websites. The scope of the associated informative materials will include guidance for a diverse group of stakeholders including content creators, browsers, authoring tools, assistive technologies, and more.</p>

		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Self validation</h3>
			<p>The WCAG 3 guidelines document shall meet its own requirements where relevant. (Some requirements may apply to organisations or scenarios not relevent to the development of a standard.)</p>
