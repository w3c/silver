To date, the group  has: </p>
			<ol>
			  <li>Researched accessibility guidance needs</li>
			  <li>Developed problem statements and opportunities to improve accessibility guidance</li>
			  <li>Received input from industry leaders for directions to proceed</li>
			  <li>  Drafted these high-level requirements for the next phase of the project, the prototyping and public input. </li>

			<p>The Requirements for Silver is published as a joint effort of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Main_Page">Silver Task Force</a> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group</a> and of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/">W3C Silver Community Group</a>. It is a work in progress, and comments are welcome as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/issues">Github Issues</a> or by <a href="mailto:public-silver@w3.org?subject=Comment%20Requirements%20for%20Silver">email</a>. </p>

			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>People with disabilities can face problems using online content and   applications. Disabilities can be permanent, temporary, or situational   limitations. </p>
            <p>We need guidelines to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>identify these barriers encountered by people with disabilities. </li>
              <li>explain how to solve the problems they pose. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The research done in 2017-2018 by the Silver Task Force, the Silver Community Group, and the <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/silver/master/prototypes/ConformancePrototype/index.html#research-partners">research partners</a> was used to identify the key problem statements related to the current accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.x, ATAG 2.0 and UAAG 2.0).  See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1POs7orJ4ALB0bq5_vyo4v8RxDcr-5ctwD1noVgpXuJc/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0">Silver Research Summary slides</a> for more detailed information. These problem statements were used to identify the opportunities for Silver to address that will improve accessibility guidance.          </p>
          <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 were designed to be   technology neutral, and has stayed relevant for over 10 years. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 has  been  implemented  in the open source authoring tool communities (chiefly Wordpress and Drupal) with little known uptake in commercial authoring tools. UAAG 2.0 offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis. There is no known user agent that has implemented all of UAAG 2.0. </p>
            <p>During   the year of Silver research, a recurring theme was the popularity and quality of the   guidance in WCAG 2.0. Most of the opportunities identified in the research were   improvements in the structure and presentation accessibility guidance to improve usability, to support more disability needs, and to improve maintenance. </p>
            
	<section>
      <h3>Comparison to WCAG 2.x Requirements</h3>
 <p>Silver builds on the<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/"> WCAG 2.0 Requirements of 2006</a>.        
      The WCAG 2.0 requirements are: 
 <ol>
   <li>Ensure that requirements may be applied across technologies</li>
   <li>Ensure that the conformance requirements are clear</li>
   <li>Design deliverables with ease of use in mind</li>
   <li>Write to a more diverse audience</li>
   <li>Clearly identify who benefits from accessible content</li>
   <li>Ensure that the revision is "backwards and forward compatible"</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Silver wishes to advance the WCAG 2.0 Requirements of:  
 <ol>
   <li value="2">clear conformance</li>
   <li>ease of use</li>
   <li>diverse audience</li>
   <li>identify who benefits</li>
 </ol>
<p>The Silver research has identified some issues with &quot;requirements may be applied across technologies&quot; and is not yet ready to include that requirement. Silver is also not ready to address &quot;Ensure that the revision is 'backwards and forward compatible'&quot; and wishes to develop prototypes and receive user feedback.  
<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/wcag21/requirements/">WCAG 2.1 Requirements</a> are very specific to WCAG 2.1 and will <em>not</em> be advanced by Silver.  
 <ol>
   <li>Define a clear conformance model for WCAG 2.1/dot.x releases</li>
   <li>Ensure the conformance structure utilizes the WCAG 2.0 A / AA / AAA model </li>
 </ol>

		  <h3 id="problem_statements">Opportunities for Silver          </h3>
		  <p>The   <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Problem_Statements#Too_Difficult_to_Read">Problem Statements</a> describe areas identified during the Silver research in   2017-2018 that  need to be addressed in the new guidelines. Each problem statement also has an opportunity section that is the basis for the Silver Requirements. </p>
          <section id="oppotunities_usability">
          <h4>Usability</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Readable</strong>: When guidelines are easier to read and understand, users – especially   people in the development cycle who are less technical – are more likely   to implement accessibility. When all audiences are considered in the   language and terminology used in the guidelines, the likelihood   increases that they will: 
              <ul>
                <li>reach a larger audience</li>
                <li>be better understood</li>
                <li>be easier to translate</li>
                <li>be interpreted as easier to implement</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>On-ramp for Beginners</strong>: When beginning users can develop understanding and mastery   of the accessibility guidance, this leads to faster and greater acceptance of   accessibility. This also creates the opportunity to convince developers   and project managers to include accessibility at the beginning of a   project instead of the end. </li>
            <li><strong> Current and Future Technology Oriented</strong>: Eliminating underlying assumptions and structure that are oriented toward the historic static web and improving guidance for modern web applications can increase acceptance by developers and provide greater accessibility of web and native applications. </li>
            <li><strong>Advocacy Tool</strong>:  Usability oriented toward a broad audience for  Silver can help improve the general advocacy   of digital accessibility. Improving the reach of Silver can help improve   the awareness of accessibility considerations. Compelling   information that is contextually relevant to the standards may also aid   in convincing audiences of any type. </li>
          </ul>
          </section>
          <section id="oppotunities_conformance">
          <h4>Conformance Model</h4>
          <p>There are several areas for exploration in how conformance can work. These opportunities may or may not be incorporated. Then need to work together, and that interplay will be governed by the design principles.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Measurable Guidance</strong>: Certain accessibility guidance is quite clear and measurable. Others, far less so. There are needs of people with disabilities, especially cognitive and low vision disabilities that are not well served by guidance that can only be measured by pass/fail statement. Multiple means of measurement  allow inclusion of more accessibility guidance. </li>
            <li><strong>Task-Based Assessment</strong>: A properly marked up button doesn't help anything if the user can&rsquo;t complete the task at hand. Task-based assessment allows flexibility for conformance of complex applications that are not conducive to component/tag assessment or full-page assessment.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility Supported</strong>: As the technologies evolve, the interoperability of content, user agents, and assistive technology will continue to blur. Interoperability may be   affected by any number of factors outside of the control of the author   and publisher of digital content. Silver can include advice to user agents and assistive technology developers so that authors are not responsible for interoperability.  </li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: As the web continues  to diversify, a conformance structure is needed that can be customized for different  uses and technologies.  A static website  for a pizza shop has different accessibility conformance needs than a social media  site being updated thousands of times per second. </li>
            <li><strong>Process guidance</strong>: Some requirements may be more important for certain websites and be very dependant on context. For example using plain language terminology in navigation is very difficult to test reliably given the constraints and context an ecommerce site has compared to a public sector website. Providing for a process to follow and document may be more appropriate for some requirements than either measurable or task-based approaches.</li> 
          </ul>
          </section>
          <section id="oppotunities_maintenance">
          <h4>Maintenance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Flexibility</strong>: A flexible structure enables greater scaling of new and expiry   of outdated guidelines. A flexible process enables   guidelines to keep pace with technology. Flexible participation – particularly of people with disabilities – empowers a community   and enables more inclusive insights. </li>
            <li> <strong>Scaling</strong>: Silver can consider multiple referring contexts, multiple use cases, and iteration   and addendums over time when designing a system and taxonomy that is as   future friendly as it is user-centric. </li>
            <li> <strong>Governance</strong>: Accessibility guidance and all supporting documentation should be as forward   looking and future friendly as possible – anticipating common scenarios   like new technology. If possible, they should also consider the   introduction of new modalities like surface reaction and ultrahaptics. Utilize tools that allow interested parties to predict when issues important to them are being discussed. Maintain a backlog that reflects issues along with their   status. </li>
            <li><strong>Evolving Technology</strong>: As content technology evolves, it must be   re-evaluated against assistive technology for compatibility. Likewise,   as assistive technology evolves or emerges, it must be evaluated against   the backward compatibility of various content technology. Silver needs a flexible design that will allow for updates as new technologies emerge, assistive technologies improve, and changing technologies produce new barriers for people with disabilities. </li>
          </ul>

		  <h2 id="design_principles">Design Principles</h2>
          <p>The Silver Design Principles are based on the requirements of WCAG 2.0 and build on those requirements to meet needs identified in the Silver research. </p>
          <p>Accessibility guidelines should:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Support the needs of the widest possible range of people with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Support a measurement and conformance structure that can include guidance for a broad range of disabilities, including low vision and cognitive accessibility needs.</li>
            <li> Be flexible enough to support the needs of people with disabilities  using emerging technologies. </li>
            <li> Be usable and accessible.</li>
            <li>Be written in plain language, as easy as possible to understand.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The development process for the guidelines should</p>
          <ol start="6">
            <li> include people with disabilities,</li>
            <li>have global participation and feedback. </li>
            <li> Be about and for people – technology is important but secondary. </li>
            <li> Strive to be data informed and evidence based. </li>
          </ol>
</section>
		<section>
		  <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
          <p>Previous W3C Accessibility Guidelines described how to make web    pages accessible to people with disabilities. These guidelines provided a     flexible framework that has kept the guidelines relevant for   10 years. Changing technology and changing needs of people with   disabilities   has shown areas where they could be improved. The   requirements are   drawn from the research performed by Silver to   improve the guidelines,   and the suggestions from the Silver Design   Sprint. </p>
          <p>The Silver Requirements   are high level and will be expanded and   refined as Silver members move   through the prototyping process. These requirements will be refined in Q3 of 2018 at the end of the     prototyping process and in 2019 after public input from the First Public     Working Draft. </p>
          <section>
          <h3>Multiple ways to measure</h3>
          <p>Different guidance has potential for different measurement. For    example, it may describe "minimal" and "better" methods of conforming to    a requirement or allow user testing and usability testing as a method of conformance. </p>
          </section>
          <section>
          <h3>Flexible structure</h3>
            <p> Create a structure for guidelines that can better meet the needs   of  people with disabilities in unanticipated technologies and   interactions.   The structure is flexible and forgiving of unanticipated   needs. </p>
            </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Multiple ways to display</h3>
            
            <p> Make the guidelines available in different accessible and usable  ways so the guidance can be customized for different audiences. </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Technology Neutral</h3>
            <p>The guidelines should cover all web technologies available to users. It is likely that a layer of the guidance will be written to be technology neutral, but the guidelines should be able to include criteria that do not work across all technologies.</p>
            <p class="ednote">Technology neutral is a requirement of WCAG 2.0 and it has enabled 2.0 to stay relevant as technology has changed. The Silver research indicates that it has also introduced challenges to users understanding, applying, and evaluating the guidance partially because it forces a level of abstraction that can be confusing to users. Silver is pursuing other solutions at this time and will relook at this requirement in a future version of this document. </p>
