				<h2>Atomic Tests</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Test Units: Each input that has specific data requirements</li>
					<li>Unit Score: For each test unit, complete each of the following tests and sum the 
						test credits to get the score</li>

						<h4>Test Procedure</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Check that instructions for input data requirements are available on the page or view</li>
							<li>Check that the instructions are persistent</li>
						</ol>

						<h4>Test Procedure</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Check that instructions for input data requirements are available on the page or view</li>
							<li>Check that the instructions are adjacent to the input</li>

					<h3>Test that instructions are predictably located</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>Test Procedure</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Check that instructions for input data requirements are available on the page or view</li>
							<li>Check that instructions display in a standard location</li>
						</ol>

					<h3>Test that instructions are programmatically defined and associated</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>Test Procedure</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Check that instructions for input data requirements are available on the page or view</li>
							<li>Check that instructions are programmatically defined and associated with the input</li>

					<h3>Scoring</h3>
						<p>Score: Percentage of inputs with specific data requirements on a page, screen, or view 
						that have persistent instructions that are adjacent to inputs, predictably located, and 
						programmatically defined and associated.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Calculate the total possible credits (total test units x total tests)</li>
							<li>Calculate the total credits (sum of test unit scores)</li>
							<li>Express total credits as a percentage of total possible credits (total credits / total possible credits)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The following example shows scoring for a page that has two inputs with specific data requirements.</p>
						<table>
							<tr>
								<th>Data</th>
								<th>Score</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Date of birth input</td>
								<td>3</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Credit card number input</td>
								<td>2</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Total credits</td>
								<td>5</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Total possible credits</td>
								<td>8 (2 inputs x 4 tests)</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Score</td>
								<td>62.5%</td>
							</tr>
