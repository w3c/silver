				<h2>How it solves user need</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>People need instructions that are available as they enter data in inputs</li>

					<li>People benefit from instructions that appear in a predictable location so they are easy to find and follow</li>
					<li>People who use screen magnification need input instructions that display next to inputs so they can see the instructions while focused on the input</li>
					<li>People who use assistive technology need instructions that are programmatically defined and associated so thay can use their technology to access the instructions while focused on the input</li>
