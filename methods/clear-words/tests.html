					<h3>Test for common words</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Unit tested:</strong> By paragraph of text or other media. </li>
						<li><strong>Test Tools:</strong> Use a common word list for your language.  The list should be at least 3000 words long. Use a tool like <a href="https://xkcd.com/simplewriter">Simplewriter.</a><span class="ednote">More research is needed on the list size.</span></li>
						<li><strong>How the individual units will be scored using a 0-2 rating:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>0 - uses undefined technical or jargon words </li>
							<li>1 - uses common words and includes a glossary (at the end of a document that the person has to navigate to and back from) </li>
							<li>2  - uses common words and defines unusual words in one click and one click return </li>
						</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
