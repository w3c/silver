				<h2>Detailed description</h2>
				<p><strong>Clear and common words:</strong> Use words or phrases that are most-frequently used for the current context, unless it will result in a loss of meaning or clarity. This includes not using abbreviations, words, or phrases, unless they are the common form to refer to concepts for beginners. Where word frequencies are known for the context, they can be used. An example would be the <a href="https://learnersdictionary.com/3000-words">Merriam Webster 3000 Core English Vocabulary Words</a>. </p>
				<p>Even languages with a small number of users have published lists of most-frequent words (such as Hebrew). If there is a natural language that does not have such a list, algorithms exist that calculate these lists for languages, or for specific contexts. Testing content against these word lists can be done manually. </p>
				<p><strong>Define unusual words:</strong> It is best to define technical or jargon words in context so that the user does not have to navigate away from the text to a glossary in a different location. There are a variety of possible solutions for defining words in context, including the use of a pop-up definition. </p>
				<p><strong>Provide a glossary:</strong> A glossary is typically an alphabetical list of terms related to a given set of content. </p>
