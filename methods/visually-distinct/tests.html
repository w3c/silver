					<h3>For non-plain-text views</h3>
					<p><strong>Unit Tested: Headings</strong> </p>
					<p><strong>Method: Create a percentage of the headings within a view that are visually distinct. </strong></p>
					<p>Compare heading content with non-heading content. The size, weight, or spacing around headings should be larger than that of non-heading content.</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Testing for plain text</h3>
					<p>For plain text documents that donâ€™t use markdown, read the document and look for content that acts as headings. Check that there are two blank lines above the heading and one blank line after the heading.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Testing for Markdown</h3>
					<p>Markdown supports two different styles for headings, but only one style supports more than two levels of headings. For visual consistency, check that one style is used consistently in the document, for example: each heading starts with one or more # characters. </p>
					<p>Markdown can also be tested using applications that support in-application markdown previews. Markdown, and a preview of the converted file, can be tested as the file is being written.
