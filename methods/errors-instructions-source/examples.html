				<h3>Example 1: Providing instructions within labels</h3>
				<p>For simple use cases, providing instructions within labels may be sufficient. 
					This approach is reliable across different web browsers and assistive technologies, 
					although it may require some additional thought to support some styling needs.
				</p>
				<p>In the example below, the required format for the "Date of Birth" is indicated by "MM/DD/YYYY"
					within the same label:
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre><label for="dob">Date of Birth (MM/DD/YYYY)</label></pre><br />
					<pre><input type="text" id="dob"></pre>
				</p>
				<h3>Example 2: Providing instructions outside of labels</h3>
				<p>Another approach to associate additional instructions with a form field is to use
					aria-describedby. Information referenced by this attribute is made available to the 
					users after the label and other information is announced.
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre><label for="date">Date</label><span id="date-tip">MM-DD-YYYY</span></pre><br />
					<pre><input type="text" id="date" aria-describedby="date-tip"></pre>
				</p>
