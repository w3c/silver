				<h2>Get Started</h2>
				<p>To get started with testing language attributes in a web page, you'll need to inspect the code in your browser. Once the page has loaded, open up your browser's developer tools and look for the <code class="el">&lt;html&gt;</code> element near the top of code&#8212;it should be on the second line, just after the <code class="el">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code> tag. Once you've found that, you need to check that it has a <code class="att">lang</code> attribute that correctly indicates the main language of the page. For example, if the main language of the page is French, you would look for <code class="el">&lt;html lang="fr"&gt;</code>.</p>

				<p>Once you've checked that the page itself is marked up correctly, you need to read the page to look for blocks of text that are in a different language. If you find a block of content in another language, use your browser's developer tools to inspect the code to check that there is a <code class="att">lang</code> attribute that correctly indicates the language that the block of text is written in. Complete this check for each block of text that's in a different human language from that of the main page.</p>

				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>For each block of content that's in a different human language than that of its parent, ensure there is <code class="att">lang</code> attribute that correctly matches the content in the block.</p>

				<h2>Applicability</h2>
				<p>This outcome applies to any <a href="#">block of text</a> that is <a href="#">included in the accessibility tree</a>.</p>

					<dd>For each test target, there is an <a href="#">ancestor</a> with a <code class="att">lang</code> attribute.</dd>
					<dt>Expectation 2:</dt>
					<dd>For each test target, the ancestor from expectation 1 has a <a href="#"><code class="att">lang</code> attribute value</a> that is a valid language tag.</dd>
					<dt>Expectation 3:</dt>
					<dd>For each test target, the language tag from expectation 2 matches that target's <a href="#">default language</a>.</dd>
