				<h2>Detailed description</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Informative images represent a simple concept or information that can be expressed in a short phrase or sentence. The text alternative should convey the meaning or content that is displayed. Usually, the text alternative can provide the important information in or about the image without describing exactly what the image looks like. </li>
					<li>An image may require a detailed, literal description if “how” the image represents a concept is important. Example: a map used in a map-reading exercise. </li>
					<li>Authors determine if an image is informative or decorative based on the reason for including the image on the page. </li>
					<li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/">WAI Alt Decision Tree</a> can help authors determine if an image is informative. </li>
					<li>If possible, the short text alternative for an informative image should completely convey its purpose and information. If this is not possible, then the short text alternative should provide a brief overview of the information. An additional, long description can convey the full information. </li>
					<li>The text alternative substitutes for the non-text content. If the non-text content was replaced by the text, the page would still provide the same function and information.</li>
					<li>When deciding which details to include in the text alternative, consider the following questions:
					<ul>
						<li>Why is this non-text content here? </li>
						<li>What information is it presenting? </li>
						<li>What purpose does it fulfill? </li>
						<li>If I could not use the non-text content, what words would I use to convey the same function and/or information? </li>
					</ul>
					 </li>
					 <li>When non-text content contains words that are important to understanding the content, the text alternative should include those words. If the image contains too much text to fit in a short text alternative, then the short alt text should provide a brief overview of the image, and a long description should convey the complete in-image text. </li>
