					<h3>Automated test for all images</h3>
					<p><strong>Unit Tested:</strong> All Images </p>
					<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Percentage (# passed/total # of img elements for all images)</p>
					<ul>
						<li>This test is measured by the number of img elements in the HTML document or the number of images in non-HTML content being tested. </li>
						<li>The percentage test result is the number passed divided by the total number of img elements or images. </li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h4>Procedure for HTML</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Run an automated test that displays the text alternative (or accessible name) for images. </li> 
							<li>Check that functional, informative, and images of text have alternative text that serves an equivalent purpose of the image
							<ul>
								<li>Functional images describe the function</li>
								<li>Informative images describe the image </li>
								<li>Images of text repeat the text or the equivalent purpose of the text.  </li>
							</ul></li>
							<li>Check that decorative images are appropriately coded (see “Decorative Images” method) so they are hidden to assistive technology. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
						<p>Check #2 and #3 are true.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Procedure for Technology Agnostic</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Examine each image in the content. </li>
							<li>Check that each image that conveys meaning has its text alternative. </li>
							<li>If the image contains text that is not purely decorative, the text alternative contains the same text. </li>
							<li>If it is within a link together with text, check that it is implemented to be ignored by assistive technology or the text alternative describes the image and supplements the link text. </li>
							<li>If it is a button, check that the text alternative indicates the button's function. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
						<p>Checks #2 and #3, or #2 and #4, or #2 and #5 are true.</p>

					<h3>Manual Tests for Informative Images [for HTML img element]</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Unit Tested:</strong>This test is scored based on the number of img elements for “Informative Images” in the HTML document. </li>
						<li><strong>Unit Tested:</strong>The success rate is a percentage equal to the number of “passing” img elements for Informative images divided by the total number of img elements for Informative Images. </li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h4>Test Procedure</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>If an img element is informative, check that it contains text in an alt attribute. </li>
							<li>Remove, hide, or mask the non-text content. </li>
							<li>Replace the non-text content with the text alternative in the alt attribute. </li>
							<li>Check that the text alternative conveys the purpose of the image. </li>
							<li>Check that the text alternative provides all relevant information in the image, including words that are important to understanding the content. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
						<p>Check #1, 4, and 5 are true. </p>
