				<h3>Room Scale Experience</h3>
				<p>Within a room scale experience a user is able to move freely around an environment to interact with digital / physical objects. In order to allow for meta-data to be attached to captions the captions should be annotated with x, y and z coordinates (i.e. 3-axis) so that the precise location of sound source can be determined.</p>
				<p class="ednote">There may also be a need to include information about 6-axis (3-axis plus rotation) in order to determine the directionality of sound</p>
				<p>Example adapted from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-ttml1-20181108/">https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-ttml1-20181108/</a></p>

				<h3>Sit Down Experience</h3>
				<p>Within a sit-down experience a user remains stationary within 3D space but can rotate around an environment. In order to allow for meta-data to be attached to captions in this situation either captions can be positioned using a similar method to Example 1, or can be positioned using their angular position in space (i.e. between 0 and 360).</p>
