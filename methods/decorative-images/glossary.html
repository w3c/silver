        <h2>Accessible Name</h2>
        <p>The <em>accessible name</em> is the programmatically determined name of a user interface element that is <a href="#included-in-the-accessibility-tree">included in the accessibility tree</a>.</p>  
        <p>The accessible name is calculated using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname">accessible name and description computation</a>.</p>
        <p>For native markup languages, such as <dfn><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></dfn> and <dfn><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr></dfn>, additional information on how to calculate the accessible name can be found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation">HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, Accessible Name and Description Computation (working draft)</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_additional">SVG Accessibility API Mappings, Name and Description (working draft)</a>.</p>
        <p>For more details, see <a href="https://act-rules.github.io/pages/examples/accessible-name/">ACT&#8217;s examples of accessible name</a>.</p>
        <div role="note">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> As per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname">accessible name and description computation</a>, each element always has an accessible name. When no accessible name is provided, the element will nonetheless be assigned an empty (<code class="language-plaintext">""</code>) one.</p>
        </div>
        <div role="note">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> As per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname">accessible name and description computation</a>, accessible names are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#terminology">flat string</a> trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace. Notably, it is not possible for a non-empty accessible name to be composed only of whitespace since these must be trimmed.</p>

      <section id="accessibility-support-for-accessible-name">
        <h2>Accessibility Support For Accessible Name</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Because the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname">accessible name and description computation</a> is not clear about which whitespace are considered, browsers behave differently when trimming and flattening the accessible name. For example, some browsers completely trim non-breaking spaces while some keep them in the accessible name.</li>
          <li>There exists a popular browser which does not perform the same trimming and flattening depending whether the accessible name comes from content, an <code class="language-text">aria-label</code> attribute, or an <code class="language-html">alt</code> attribute.</li>
          <li>There exists a popular browser which assign no accessible name (<code class="language-text">null</code>) when none is provided, instead of assigned an empty accessible name (<code class="language-text">""</code>).</li>
          <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname">accessible name and description computation</a> suggest that if an <code class="language-text">aria-labelledby</code> attribute refers to an existing but empty element, the computation should stop and return an empty name without defaulting to the next steps. Several user agents and assistive technologies chose to use the next step in the computation in this case.</li>
          </ul>

      <section id="accessibility-support-for-definition-of-semantic-role-for-semantic-role">
        <h2>Accessibility Support For Definition Of Semantic Role For Semantic Role</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There exist popular web browsers and assistive technologies which do not correctly implement <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#conflict_resolution_presentation_none">Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution</a>. These technologies will not <a href="#included-in-the-accessibility-tree">include in the accessibility tree</a> elements that should be, according to Specifications. Thus, some elements that should have their <em>semantic role</em> fixed by case <strong>Conflict</strong> above are instead falling into case <strong>Explicit</strong> and are hidden for users of assistive technologies.</li>
          <li>A similar conflict exists for <a href="#focusable">focusable</a> elements with a <code class="language-text">aria-hidden="true"</code> attribute. The WAI ARIA specification does not explain how to solve it. Some browsers give precedence to the element being focusable (and expose it in the accessibility tree) while some give precedence to the <code class="language-text">aria-hidden</code> attribute (and hide the element).</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="accessibility-support-for-explicit-semantic-role">
        <h2>Accessibility Support For Explicit Semantic Role</h2>
        <p>Some browsers and assistive technologies treat the tokens of the <code class="language-text">role</code> attribute as case-sensitive. Unless lowercase letters are used for the value of the <code class="language-text">role</code> attribute, not all user agents will be able to interpret the tokens correctly. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/">ARIA in HTML (working draft)</a> also specifies that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#case-sensitivity">authors must use lowercase letters for the <code class="language-text">role</code> and <code class="language-text">aria-*</code> attributes</a>.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility Support For Implicit Semantic Role</h2>
        <p>Images with an empty <code class="language-html">alt</code> attribute should have an implicit role of <code class="language-text">presentation</code>, according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#html-element-role-mappings">HTML Accessibility API Mapping (work in progress)</a>. However, there are several popular browsers that do not treat images with empty <code class="language-html">alt</code> attribute as having a role of <code class="language-text">presentation</code>. Instead, they add the <code class="language-html">img</code> element to the accessibility tree with a role of either <code class="language-html">img</code> or <code class="language-text">graphic</code>.</p>

      <section id="current-request">
        <h2>Current Request</h2>
        <p>An <code class="language-html">img</code> element has a current request and a pending request. The current request is initially set to a new image request. The pending request is initially set to null.</p>

      <section id="explicit-semantic-role">
        <h2>Explicit Semantic Role</h2>
        <p>The <em>explicit semantic role</em> of an element is determined by its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/role-attribute/">role attribute</a> (if any).</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/role-attribute/">role attribute</a> takes a list of tokens. The explicit semantic role is the first valid role in this list. The valid roles are all non-abstract roles from <a href="#wai-aria-specifications">WAI-ARIA Specifications</a>. If the element has no <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/role-attribute/">role attribute</a>, or if it has one with no valid role, then this element has no explicit semantic role.</p>
        <p>Other roles may be added as they become available. Not all roles will be supported in all assistive technologies. Testers are encouraged to adjust which roles are allowed according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/#step1c">accessibility support base line</a>. For the purposes of executing test cases in all rules, it should be assumed that all roles are supported by assistive technologies so that none of the roles fail due to lack of accessibility support.</p>

        <h2>Implicit Semantic Role</h2>
        <p>The <em>implicit semantic role</em> of an element is a pre-defined value given by the host language which depends on the element and its ancestors.</p> 
        <p>Implicit roles for HTML and SVG, are documented in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/#html-element-role-mappings">HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/#mapping_role_table">SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Included In The Accessibility Tree</h2>
        <p>Elements included in the accessibility tree of platform specific accessibility <dfn><abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></dfn>s. Elements in the accessibility tree are exposed to assistive technologies, allowing users to interact with the elements in a way that meet the requirements of the individual user.</p>
        <p>The general rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree are defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/">core accessibility API mappings</a>. For native markup languages, such as HTML and SVG, additional rules for when elements are included in the accessibility tree can be found in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/">HTML accessibility API mappings (working draft)</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam/">SVG accessibility API mappings (working draft)</a>.</p>

        <div role="note">
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Users of assistive technologies might still be able to interact with elements that are not included in the accessibility tree. An example of this is a <a href="#focusable">focusable</a> element with an <code class="language-plaintext">aria-hidden</code> attribute with a value of <code class="language-plaintext">true</code>. Such an element could still be interacted using sequential keyboard navigation regardless of the assistive technologies used, even though the element would not be included in the accessibility tree.</p>

        <h2>Marked As Decorative</h2>
        <p>An element is <em>marked as decorative</em> if one of the following conditions is true:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>it has an <a href="#explicit-role">explicit role</a> of <code class="language-plaintext">none</code> or <code class="language-plaintext">presentation</code>; or</li>
          <li>it is an <code class="language-html">img</code> element with an <code class="language-html">alt</code> attribute whose value is the empty string (<code class="language-html">alt=""</code>), and with no <a href="#explicit-role">explicit role</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Elements are marked as decorative as a way to convey the intention of the author that they are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-pure-decoration">pure decoration</a>. It is different from the element actually being <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-pure-decoration">pure decoration</a> as authors may make mistakes. It is different from the element being effectively ignored by assistive technologies as rules such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#conflict_resolution_presentation_none">presentational roles conflict resolution</a> may overwrite this intention.</p>
        <p>Elements can also be ignored by assistive technologies if their <a href="#hidden-state">hidden state</a> is true. This is different from marking the element as decorative and does not convey the same intention. Notably, the <a href="#hidden-state">hidden state</a> of an element may change as users interact with the page (showing and hiding elements) while being marked as decorative should stay the same through all states of the page.</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>An <em>outcome</em> is a conclusion that comes from evaluating an <dfn><abbr title="Accessibility Conformance Testing">ACT</abbr></dfn> Rule on a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject">test subject</a> or one of its constituent <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target">test target</a>. An outcome can be one of the three following types:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Inapplicable:</dt>
          <dd>No part of the test subject matches the applicability.</dd>
          <dt>Passed:</dt>
          <dd>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target">test target</a> meets all expectations.</dd>
          <dt>Failed:</dt>
          <dd>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-target">test target</a> does not meet all expectations</dd>

When there are no test targets the rule has one <code class="language-plaintext">inapplicable</code> outcome. This means that each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/#test-subject">test subject</a> will have one or more outcomes.</p>

In addition to <code class="language-plaintext">passed</code>, <code class="language-plaintext">failed</code> and <code class="language-plaintext">inapplicable</code>, <dfn><abbr title="Evaluation And Report Language">EARL</abbr></dfn> 1.0 also defined an <code class="language-plaintext">incomplete</code> outcome. While this cannot be the outcome of an ACT Rule when applied in its entirety, it often happens that rules are only partially evaluated. For example, when applicability was automated, but the expectations have to be evaluated manually.
