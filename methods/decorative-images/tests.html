					<h3>Automated test for all images</h3>
					<p><strong>Unit Tested:</strong> All Images </p>
					<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Percentage (# passed/total # of img elements for all images)</p>
					<ul>
						<li>This test is measured by the number of img elements in the HTML document or the number of images in non-HTML content being tested. </li>
						<li>The percentage test result is the number passed divided by the total number of img elements or images. </li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h4>Procedure for HTML</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Run an automated test that displays the text alternative (or accessible name) for images. </li> 
							<li>Check that functional, informative, and images of text have alternative text that serves an equivalent purpose of the image
							<ul>
								<li>Functional images describe the function</li>
								<li>Informative images describe the image </li>
								<li>Images of text repeat the text or the equivalent purpose of the text.  </li>
							</ul></li>
							<li>Check that decorative images are appropriately coded (see “Decorative Images” method) so they are hidden to assistive technology. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
						<p>Check #2 and #3 are true.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Procedure for Technology Agnostic</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Examine each image in the content. </li>
							<li>Check that each image that conveys meaning has its text alternative. </li>
							<li>If the image contains text that is not purely decorative, the text alternative contains the same text. </li>
							<li>If it is within a link together with text, check that it is implemented to be ignored by assistive technology or the text alternative describes the image and supplements the link text. </li>
							<li>If it is a button, check that the text alternative indicates the button's function. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
						<p>Checks #2 and #3, or #2 and #4, or #2 and #5 are true.</p>

					<h3>Manual test of a CSS background image</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Unit Tested:</strong> All CSS background images</li>
						<li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Percentage (# passed/total # of elements for “CSS background images”)The percentage test result is the number passed divided by the total number of elements or images.</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h4>Test Procedure</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Check for the presence of decorative images.</li>
							<li>Check that they are included as CSS background images.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
						<p>If #1 is true then #2 is true.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Manual test of CSS generated content</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Unit Tested:</strong> All CSS generated content</li>
						<li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Percentage (# passed/total # of elements for “CSS generated content”)The percentage test result is the number passed divided by the total number of elements or images.</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h4>Test Procedure</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Check for the presence of decorative images.</li>
							<li>Check if decorative images are included using CSS generated content.</li>
							<li>Check that the image has an empty alt value.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
						<p>If 1 is true then 2 and 3 are true.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

					<h3>Manual test if an image uses null alt text and no title attribute for decorative images</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Unit Tested:</strong> All decorative HTML images</li>
						<li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Percentage (# passed/total # of elements for “decorative HTML images”)The percentage test result is the number passed divided by the total number of elements or images.</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h4>Test Procedure</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Check for the presence of decorative images</li>
							<li>Check that the <code>title</code> attribute is either absent <strong>or</strong> has no value.</li>
							<li>Check that the alt attribute is present <strong>and</strong> has no value. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
