				<h2>Detailed description</h2>
				<p>The intent of this method is to ensure that authors can add alternative content for non-text content and modify that alternative content in the future.</p>
				<p>If the type of alternative content (e.g. alternative text) is not typically displayed on screen by user agents, then WYSIWYG editing-views may not display it. This is acceptable as long as another mechanism is provided for modifying that alternative content (e.g. an <q>Image Properties</q> dialog).</p>
				<p>The mechanism for adding or editing alternative text can vary by the type of authoring tool.  A simple source code editor could allow editing of the source code.  A more sophisticated source code editor could highlight the alternative text when the image is selected. A WYSIWYG editor can display a properties dialog box that allows editing of the image properties including the alternative text.  It is important that the ability to edit the alternative text is at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#def-At-Least-As-Prominent">least as prominent</a> as other image properties. </p>
