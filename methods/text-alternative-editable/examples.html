				<h3>Source content editing-view</h3>
				<p>In a source editing-view, alternative content within the source is always available, regardless of what user agents might render. If alternative content is referenced from an external location (e.g. HTML4 longdesc), then that resource can be opened for editing.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Properties dialog</h3>
				<p>In a WYSIWYG editing-view, alternative content is not displayed, since the editing-view is designed to mimic typical user agents. However, the alternative content can be accessed and edited via a properties editor that displays the properties for the content that currently has focus</p>
