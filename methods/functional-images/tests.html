					<h3>Automated test for all images</h3>
					<p><strong>Unit Tested:</strong> All Images </p>
					<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Percentage (# passed/total # of img elements for all images)</p>
					<ul>
						<li>This test is measured by the number of img elements in the HTML document or the number of images in non-HTML content being tested. </li>
						<li>The percentage test result is the number passed divided by the total number of img elements or images. </li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h4>Procedure for HTML</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Run an automated test that displays the text alternative (or accessible name) for images. </li> 
							<li>Check that functional, informative, and images of text have alternative text that serves an equivalent purpose of the image
							<ul>
								<li>Functional images describe the function</li>
								<li>Informative images describe the image </li>
								<li>Images of text repeat the text or the equivalent purpose of the text.  </li>
							</ul></li>
							<li>Check that decorative images are appropriately coded (see “Decorative Images” method) so they are hidden to assistive technology. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
						<p>Check #2 and #3 are true.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Procedure for Technology Agnostic</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Examine each image in the content. </li>
							<li>Check that each image that conveys meaning has its text alternative. </li>
							<li>If the image contains text that is not purely decorative, the text alternative contains the same text. </li>
							<li>If it is within a link together with text, check that it is implemented to be ignored by assistive technology or the text alternative describes the image and supplements the link text. </li>
							<li>If it is a button, check that the text alternative indicates the button's function. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Expected Results</h4>
						<p>Checks #2 and #3, or #2 and #4, or #2 and #5 are true.</p>

					<h3>Manual Test of Functional Images</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Unit Tested:</strong>This test is measured by the number of the following elements only for “Functional Images” in the HTML document
						<ul>
							<li>img elements</li>
							<li>input elements with type=”image”</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Measurement:</strong>Percentage (# passed/total # of img elements for “Functional Images”)</li>
					</ol>
					<section>
					<h4>Procedure [for HTML]</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Examine each img element in the content </li>
						<li>Check that each img element which conveys meaning contains an alt attribute. </li>
						<li>If the image contains text that is not purely decorative, the value of the alt attribute is the same as the text. </li>
						<li>If it is within a link together with text, check that an img element within an a element has either a null alt attribute value or a value that supplements the link text and describes the image </li>
						<li>If it is a button, check that the text alternative indicates the button's function. </li>
					</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h4>Expected Results</h4>
					<p>Checks #1 and #2 are true</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If a functional image is not purely decorative and CSS is used instead of an img or input (type=”image”) element, that does not pass.</li>
						<li>If a functional image is not purely decorative and the img or input (type=”image”) element doesn’t have an alt attribute, that does not pass. </li>
						<li>If a functional image is not purely decorative and the value of the alt attribute of the img or input (type=”image”) element is not the equivalent of the image, that does not pass.</li> 

					</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h4>Procedure [Technology Agnostic]</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Examine each functional image in the content. </li>
						<li>Check that each functional image that conveys meaning has its text alternative. </li>
						<li>If the image contains text that is not purely decorative, the text alternative contains the same text.  </li>
						<li>If it is within a link together with text, check that it is implemented to be ignored by assistive technology or the text alternative describes the image and supplements the link text. </li>
						<li>If it is a button, check that the text alternative indicates the button's function. </li>
					</ol>
					</section>
