				<h2>Detailed description</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Functional images are used to initiate actions rather than to convey information. They are used in buttons, links, and other interactive elements. The text alternative for the image should convey the action that will be initiated (the purpose of the image), rather than a description of the image. For instance, as shown in examples, the text alternative should be “print this page” rather than “(image of a) printer”, “search” rather than “magnifying lens” or “Example.com homepage” rather than “Example.com logo”. </li>
					<li>Missing or empty alt values create significant problems for screen reader users because functional images are essential to the functionality of the content. Screen readers will typically announce the image file name, the image URL, or the URL for the link destination, which is unlikely to help users understand the action that will be initiated by the image.</li>
					<li>When an <code>a</code> element that is a hyperlink, or a <code>button</code> element, has no text content but contains one or more images, include text in the <code>alt</code> attribute(s) that together convey the purpose of the link or button.</li>
