				<h2>Detailed description</h2>
			<p>Every page should have only one perceivable H1-type heading.  There may be more than one in the code, but only one is in view or in the accessibility tree at one time. </p>
			<p>There are two ways to approach providing structure in HTML: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Native HTML semantic tags, such as <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> </li>
				<li>ARIA attributes for HTML tags  </li>
				<li>Use one or the other.  Donâ€™t use both in the same tag or element.   </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Headings are not only used for organizing text.  Headings are also used to organize forms, controls, multimedia and complex applications. They help people locate the information or controls they need.  </p>

				<p><strong>Exception for fixed page sections:</strong></p>
				<p>In fixed sections of the page, for example in sidebars, the heading ranks <em>should not</em> change depending on the ranks in the content area. In those cases, consistency across pages is more important.</p>
