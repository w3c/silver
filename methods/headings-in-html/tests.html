				<h2>Atomic Tests</h2>
				<p><strong>Unit Tested: </strong>Visual headings</p>

				<p><strong>Method: </strong> Create a percentage of the visual headings within a view that have correctly coded as a heading, are coded at the correct level, and can be used as navigation. </p>

					<h3>Using h1-h6 to identify headings</h3>
					<p>This test is measured by the number of visual headings on a page, screen, or view </p>
					<p>Test results are by percentage (# passed/total # of headings)</p>

					<h4>Procedure [for each test]</h4>
					<ol><li>Check that heading markup is used when content is a heading and the heading markup indicates the appropriate heading level for the content.</li>
					<li>Check that heading markup is not used when content is not a heading</li></ol>

					<h4>Procedure [for each test]</h4>
					<ol><li>Examine each element with the attribute role="heading". </li>
					<li>Determine whether the content of the element is appropriate as a heading.</li>
					<li>If the element has an aria-level attribute, determine whether the value is the appropriate hierarchical level.</li></ol>

					<h3>Test for accuracy of heading levels</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Don’t skip levels when going deeper into the hierarchy (i.e. don’t go from H2 to H4).</li>
						<li>You may skip levels when going higher into the hierarchy if it is internally consistent with your header structure (i.e. you may go from H4 to H2).</li>
					<li>Avoid having two headers immediately adjacent with no content in between them.</li>
