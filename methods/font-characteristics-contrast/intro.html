				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Visual readability of text requires good visual contrast. Visual contrast is a product of the text characteristics, such as font weight (thickness) and font size, the lightness/darkness difference of the colors used for the text and the background, and other factors.</p>
				<p>Using objective guidelines and tools, evaluate font stroke width (weight), font size, background color, font color, and nearby colors and adjust the properties of those elements to achieve good visual contrast and readability.</p>

			<section id="user-need">
				<h2>How it solves user need</h2>
				<p>All sighted users need adequate text size and weight, coupled with ample luminance contrast (lightness/darkness difference) between background and text colors, in order to read the text easily. </p>
