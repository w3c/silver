				<h2>Outcome</h2>
				<p>This method supports the outcome <a href="../../outcomes/luminance-contrast-between-background-and-text.html" class="outcome-link">Luminance contrast between background and text</a>.</p>

				<h2>Detailed description</h2>
				<p>The visual contrast needed for easy reading of text is substantially higher than the contrast needed to simply "make out" words. At least ten times more contrast is needed for good <em>readability</em> than the bare minimum contrast needed for <em>legibility</em>.</p>
				
				<p>Perception of contrast is affected not only by the lightness and darkness of the colors used for the text and background, but also by the weight (thickness) of the font, the font's size, and the relative spacing of lines and letters.</p>
				
				<p>A person's contrast sensitivity shifts throughout their lifetime, and visual impairments can cause a substantial reduction in contrast perception, requiring higher contrast text for the same readability. Some impairments can make it difficult to see certain hues, so it is important to ensure enough luminance contrast (lightness/darkness), and not to rely on color contrasts of hue and saturation.</p>
				
				<p>Because a person's contrast perception is so variable, it is difficult for any one individual to judge what makes a good readable contrast for all. The solution is to use objective guidelines and tools to evaluate font stroke width (weight), font size, background and font colors to ensure good visual contrast and readability.</p>
