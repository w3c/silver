				<h3 id="example1">Link Image</h3>
				<p>An image on a Website provides a link to a free newsletter. The image contains the text <q>Free newsletter. Get free recipes, news, and more. Learn more.</q> The alt text matches the text in the image.</p>
				<img src="img/newsletter.gif" alt="Example of image text: Free newsletter. Get free recipes, news, and more. Learn more." width="208" height="96" />>
<pre>
&lt;img src="newsletter.gif" alt="Free newsletter. Get free recipes, news, and more. Learn more.">

				<h3 id="example2">Styled text with decorative effect</h3>
				<p>This following image is used to convey a slogan text with decorative effects.  This example is from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#styled-text-with-decorative-effect">WAI Tutorials Images</a>.  See the WAI Tutorials for more examples and CSS solutions. </p>
				<img src="img/bad-top-text-d37f250b.png" alt="Example of decorative text: Your access to the city." />>
<pre>
&lt;img src="access-city.png" alt="Your access to the city.">
</pre>
<p>The text alternative for this image is the same as the slogan presented in the image: “Your access to the city”. The decorative effects (stylized text and shadow) are not described because they are not relevant.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="example">
				<h3 id="example3">Image of text used as an unlinked logo</h3>
				<p>The following image is the logo for the Web Accessibility Initiative. It is not part of a link, so the text alternative is “Web Accessibility Initiative”. There’s no need to mention that it is a logo. This example is from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#image-of-text-used-as-an-unlinked-logo">WAI Tutorials Images</a>.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> If this logo were linked then it would become a functional image. See “Example 7” and “Example 8” in the Method “Text alternative for Functional Images”.</p>
				<img src="img/wai-75196dbb.png" alt="Example of unlinked logo: Web Accessibility initiative" />>
<pre>
&lt;img src="wai.png" alt="Web Accessibility initiative">
</pre>

			<section class="example">
				<h3 id="example4">Mathematical expressions</h3>
				<p>The image below displays a recurring decimal number (decimal numbers that never end). The alt text for this recurring number is “0.3333 recurring. (In the image, the recurrence is indicated by a line over the ‘3’ in the fourth decimal place.)”</p>
				<p>In this particular example, the way that the recurrence is shown is important, so it is also described in the text alternative. As with other images, the author is in the best position to determine what information is intended to be conveyed by the image and construct the text alternative accordingly.</p>
				<p>This example is from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#using-images">WAI Tutorials Images</a>.  </p>
				<img src="img/repeat1-90c4c517.png" alt="Example of math expression: 0.3333 recurring. (The recurrence is indicated by a line over the ‘3’ in the fourth decimal place)" />>
<pre>
&lt;img src="0dot3333recurring.png" alt="0.3333 recurring. (The recurrence is indicated by a line over the ‘3’ in the fourth decimal place)">
</pre>
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: Historically, math expressions have often been presented as images because of the difficulty of presenting equations and special math symbols with HTML. However, MathML is emerging as the preferred presentation of accessible math on the Web. See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/textual/#using-images">WAI Tutorials Images</a> for examples of MathML solutions. </p>

				<h3 id="example5">Image of text for a heading</h3>
				<p>This example shows an image of the text <q>Get Happy!</q> written in a fancy multi colored freehand style. The image makes up the content of a heading. In this case the text alternative for the image is <q>Get Happy!</q>. This example is from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/semantics-embedded-content.html#images-of-text">EXAMPLE 34 of HTML 5.3</a>. </p>
				<img src="img/gethappy.png" alt="Example of image used as a heading: Get Happy" />
<pre>
&lt;h1>&lt;img src="gethappy.gif" alt="Get Happy!">&lt;/h1>
</pre>

			<section class="example">
				<h3 id="example6">An advertising image consisting of text</h3>
				<p>n this example we have an advertising image consisting of text, the phrase <q>The BIG sale</q> is repeated 3 times, each time the text gets smaller and fainter, the last line reads <q>...ends Friday</q> In the context of use, as an advertisement, it is recommended that the image’s text alternative only include the text <q>The BIG sale</q> once as the repetition is for visual effect and the repetition of the text for users who cannot view the image is unnecessary and could be confusing. This example is from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/semantics-embedded-content.html#example-ee4a6773">EXAMPLE 35 of HTML 5.3</a>. </p>
				<img src="img/thebigsale.png" alt="Example: The Big Sale" />
<pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="sale.gif" alt="The BIG sale ...ends Friday.">&lt;/p>
</pre>
				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In situations where there is also a photo or other graphic along with the image of text, ensure that the words in the image text are included in the text alternative, along with any other description of the image that conveys meaning to users who can view the image, so the information is also available to users who cannot view the image.</p>

				<h3 id="example7">Inline image of a character: A new-fangled currency symbol </h3>
				<p>In this example from 1997, a new-fangled currency symbol that looks like a curly E with two bars in the middle instead of one is represented using an image. The alternative text gives the character’s pronunciation. This example is from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/semantics-embedded-content.html#example-99a2d0dd">EXAMPLE 36 of HTML 5.3</a>.</p>
				<p>Only <img src="img/euro.png" alt="euro " />5.99!</p>
<pre>
&lt;p>Only &lt;img src="euro.png" alt="euro ">5.99!&lt;/p>
</pre>
				<p>An image should not be used if Unicode characters would serve an identical purpose. Only when the text cannot be directly represented using Unicode, e.g., because of decorations or because the character is not in the Unicode character set (as in the case of gaiji), would an image be appropriate. </p>
				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If an author is tempted to use an image because their default system font does not support a given character, then <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WOFF2-20180301/">Web Fonts</a> are a better solution than images.</p>

				<h3 id="example8">An illuminated manuscript</h3>
				<p>An illuminated manuscript might use graphics for some of its letters. The text alternative in such a situation is just the character that the image represents. This example is from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/semantics-embedded-content.html#example-bb24157f">EXAMPLE 37 of HTML 5.3</a>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/fancyO.png" alt="Example of Manuscript: O" />nce upon a time and a long long time ago…</p>
<pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="initials/fancyO.png" alt="O">nce upon a time and a long long time ago...
</pre>
			</section>
			<section class="example">
				<h3 id="example9">An illuminated letter</h3>
				<p>Where the design of the illuminated letter is important, the primary text alternative in is the character that the image represents, and longdesc can provide a link to a more detailed description. This example is from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/semantics-embedded-content.html#example-6af6c3a6">EXAMPLE 38 of HTML 5.3</a>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/drop_o.jpg" alt="Example of:O" longdesc="letters/story-0.html" />nce upon a time and a long long time ago...</p>

<pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="initials/story-o.jpg" alt="O" longdesc="letters/story-0.html">nce upon a time and a long long time ago...
