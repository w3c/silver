				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>Text alternatives for images of text makes information conveyed by non-text content accessible through the use of a text alternative. Text alternatives are a primary way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. A person who cannot hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Images of text display text that is intended to be read. With the current CSS capabilities in most web browsers, it is good design practice to use actual text that is styled with CSS rather than image-based text presentation. Genuine text is much more flexible than images: It can be resized without losing clarity, and background and text colors can be modified to suit the reading preferences of users. Images are more likely to distort and pixelate when resized. In those rare situations where images of text must be used, the text alternative must contain the same text presented in the image. </li>
					<li>When using the <code>img</code> element, specify a short text alternative with the <code>alt</code> attribute. Note: The value of this attribute is referred to as <q>alt text</q>. </li>
					<li>When an image contains words that are important to understanding the content, the alt text should include those words. This will allow the alt text to play the same function on the page as the image. Note that it does not necessarily describe the visual characteristics of the image itself but must convey the same meaning as the image.  </li>
					<li>Sometimes, an image only contains text, and the purpose of the image is to display text using visual effects and /or fonts. It is strongly recommended that text styled using CSS be used, but if this is not possible, provide the same text in the <code>alt</code> attribute as is in the image. </li>

				<h2>How it solves user need</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>People using screen readers:</strong> The text alternative can be read aloud or rendered as Braille. </li>
					<li><strong>People using speech input software:</strong> Users can put the focus onto a button or linked image with a single voice command.  </li>
					<li><strong>People browsing speech-enabled websites:</strong> The text alternative can be read aloud.  </li>
					<li><strong>Mobile web users:</strong> Images can be turned off, especially for data-roaming.  </li>
					<li><strong>Search engine optimization:</strong> Images become indexable by search engines.  </li>
