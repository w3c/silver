				<h2>Detailed description</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Images of text display text that is intended to be read. With the current CSS capabilities in most web browsers, it is good design practice to use actual text that is styled with CSS rather than image-based text presentation. Genuine text is much more flexible than images: It can be resized without losing clarity, and background and text colors can be modified to suit the reading preferences of users. Images are more likely to distort and pixelate when resized. In those rare situations where images of text must be used, the text alternative must contain the same text presented in the image. </li>
					<li>When using the <code>img</code> element, specify a short text alternative with the <code>alt</code> attribute. Note: The value of this attribute is referred to as <q>alt text</q>. </li>
					<li>When an image contains words that are important to understanding the content, the alt text should include those words. This will allow the alt text to play the same function on the page as the image. Note that it does not necessarily describe the visual characteristics of the image itself but must convey the same meaning as the image.  </li>
					<li>Sometimes, an image only contains text, and the purpose of the image is to display text using visual effects and /or fonts. It is strongly recommended that text styled using CSS be used, but if this is not possible, provide the same text in the <code>alt</code> attribute as is in the image. </li>
