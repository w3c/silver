				<h3>Example 1</h3>
				<p>A conversation is taking place between a group of people at a virtual  meeting and a deaf user is tracking this discussion - there may be colour coding to distinguish the speakers and the caption colours may be related.</p>

				<p>The deaf user may later wish to explore the environment or look at some thing - and therefore move focus from the speakers but dock the captions, or keep them in some bespoke view. Therefore the speaker source and ‘their’ captions relationship can be maintained.</p>

				<p class="ednote">This relationship maybe as simple as a text saying ‘Speaker name: Lorraine’, ‘Speaker name: Ruairi’ or similar. Or could be provided in markup. Providing the association of ‘source/caption’  in markup would allow greater movement, and further potential transformations.</p>
