				<h2>Outcome and Functional Categories</h2>
				<p>This method supports the outcome <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2020/outcomes/conveys-information-about-the-sound">Conveys information about the sound</a>.</p>
				<p>Applies to immersive environments that support text equivalents (such as captions or transcripts) of audio track. </p>

				<h3>Maintaining reflow context in XR for Captions</h3>
				<p>Content should not lose its context. This means that when captioning is related to speech they maintain their relationship with the source. If captioned text within the environment needs to be moved there is a persistent parent / child relationship between the related source and the related caption that enables either to be moved or other transformations to take place.</p>
				<p>See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/issues/139">https://github.com/w3c/silver/issues/139</a> for example of traditional content in XR environment</p>

				<h3>Anti-Aliasing or use of vector graphics of Captions</h3>
				<p>Depending on the environment - Captions should be resized without loss of quality. This may mean anti-aliasing options need to be available in XR or requiring the use of vector style graphics for captions and other text, which means they will resize more easily without loss of quality.</p>
