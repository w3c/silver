			<h1>Outcome: Text alternative available for user generated content</h1>
			<p class="outcome">If the content is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#user-generated-content">user generated content</a>, then a text alternative mechanism for non-text content is available via user agents and assistive technologies. This mechanism allows users who are unable to perceive and / or understand the non-text content to determine its meaning. To support users in creating accessible content, the publisher of the user generated content:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provides functionality for adding non-text content, then users are able to modify programmatically associated text alternatives for non-text content.</li>
				<li>Provides functionality to check if Generic strings (e.g. "image") and irrelevant strings (e.g. the file name, file format) are not used as text alternatives </li>
				<li>If the repair attempt occurs during an authoring session, provides users the opportunity to accept, modify, or reject the repair attempt prior to insertion of the text alternative into the content.</li>
				<li>If the repair attempt occurs after an authoring session has ended, the repaired text alternatives are indicated during subsequent authoring sessions (if any) and users have the opportunity to accept, modify, or reject the repair strings prior to insertion in the content. </li>
				<li>Provides the functionality for adding non-text content, when users enter programmatically associated text alternatives for non-text content AND the text alternatives are automatically saved and suggested by the authoring tool, if the same non-text content is reused. </li>
				<li>Provides the functionality for adding non-text content, when users enter programmatically associated text alternatives for non-text content AND the author has the option to edit or delete the saved text alternatives.
			</ul>
			<p>The above references are adapted from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b23">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 B.2.3</a>  Assist authors with managing alternative content for non-text content. </p>
			<p class="ednote">Note: How the specific details of this outcome will be managed and what is required vs what is recommended still needs discussion.  This is an example of how an outcome could be used with user generated content.  </p>
			<p class="ednote">The scoring system is being revised, but we envision that the conformance score for the publisher of the user generated content will recognize the publishing doing increasing amounts of the previous list. </p>
