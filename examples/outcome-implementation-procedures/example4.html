		<h1>Example outcome evaluation procedure: Omnibus procedure for multiple outcomes</h1>
		<p class="note">Note: This example shows an outcome implementation procedure that addresses multiple outcomes. The reason for this is that many outcomes are likely to have similar implementation procedures, in this example focused on training, incorporation into workflow, and periodic check-ins. It would be burdensome for organizations to follow and track multiple similar implementation procedures, so grouping together into a single procedure may result in better effectiveness.</p>

			<h2>2. Accessibility guidance</h2>
			<p>The following resources provide guidance about various aspects of the outcomes supported by this outcome implementation procedure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/low-or-no-background-audio">Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.7: Low or No Background Audio</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/patterns/o1p04-clear-steps/">Make Each Step Clear</a> design pattern</li>

			<h2>3. Implementation procedures</h2>
			<p>Note: because this is an omnibus procedure, the procedures here need to be more extensive than in the simpler procedures, in order to ensure all the outcomes have attention throughout the process. Those edits are not yet made.</p>
			<p>All roles (designer, coder, manager) read the accessibility guidance.</p>
			<p>The team conducts approximately 4 hours of meetings to discuss how the guidance relates to their organization’s site, from each of their roles.</p>
			<p>A team member produces a short report describing attention points for the guidance.</p>
			<p>The team conducts monthly check-in meetings to discuss their progress on applying the guidance in their daily work, and to refine the plan.</p>
			<p>The team performs semi-annual reviews of the help and support resources available on the site.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="evaluation-procedures">
			<h2>4. Evaluation procedures</h2>
			<p>The report describing attention points serves as a milestone that the procedure has been implemented.</p>
			<p>Frequency and duration of meetings related to the task are tracked for a given annual period. Frequency should be 12 / year, duration should be 1 hour / meeting. The score is the actual vs benchmark ratio.</p>
			<p>We use the following evaluation procedures in the newly-released Help and Support Evaluation Procedure published as a companion to the Making Contnet Usable Protocol:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We have evaluated all content and ensured compliance with all relavant WCAG 3.0 methods and maintain a X conformance level for all web support offerings. <a href="#">See the results from our latest audit</a>.</li>
				<li>We offer live telephone support. To ensure all staff are properly trained in accessible communication methods, we require staff to take X curriculum and test all staff twice a year. Staff are required to acheive a score of at least X to serve customers.</li>
				<li>We hire people with disabilties sourced by X company to test our support processes annually. X company provides an indepdentant report and we remediate any findings from that testing within 90 days.</li>
				<li>To ensure even greater accessibility, Company X has developed Open A11y 100 software. This software lints code to help software developers implement new W3C standards, including ones related to personalization and content pronounciation.</li>
				<li>To ensure we meet the needs of everyone, we annually have X Company, who specializes in conformance beyond WCAG 3.0 methods to audit our web help options. <a href="#">See the results from our latest audit</a>. All findings are remediated within 180 days.</li>
				<li>For any customer who is unable to obtain support through our Help line or Portal, our company provides trained Customer Success Agents who work with the customer directly in the format they prefer. Our company records logs from those support cases and uses them to inform the design of new Help Portal features and in staff training/assessments.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>5. Scoring information</h2>
			<p>When implementation is demonstrated with the initial report, the relevant outcomes score at the lowest level of conformance.</p>
			<p>Note: higher conformance levels would require additional evaluation of the implementation procedures, beyond the baseline.</p>
