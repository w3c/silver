			<h2>2. Accessibility guidance</h2>
			<p>Developers in all roles use <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o7-support/">cognitive accessibility guidance to Provide Help and Support</a> published as a supplement to WCAG 2.</p>
			<p>Note: The definition of "use" could change based on the conformance level. For lower levels of conformance, we're primary looking at the proedures an organization has put in place to measure a protocol. These controls help assure users that guidance is being followed, though outputs are not normally measured at this level. At higher conformance levels the output of the procedure implementation will be measured with varying degrees of rigour depending on the level of conformance claimed. All protocols will have evaluation measures. All results of evaluations must be publicy documented at higher conformance levels. At lower conformance levels, documentation of procedures is sufficent.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="implementation-procedures">
			<h2>3. Implementation procedures</h2>
			<p>All roles (designer, coder, manager) read the accessibility guidance.</p>
			<p>The team conducts a 2-hour meeting to discuss how the guidance relates to their organizationâ€™s site, from each of their roles.</p>
			<p>A team member produces a short report describing attention points for the guidance.</p>
			<p>The team conducts monthly check-in meetings to discuss their progress on applying the guidance in their daily work, and to refine the plan.</p>
			<p>The team performs semi-annual reviews of the help and support resources available on the site.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="evaluation-procedures">
			<h2>4. Evaluation procedures</h2>
			<p>The report describing attention points serves as a milestone that the procedure has been implemented.</p>
			<p>Frequency and duration of meetings related to the task are tracked for a given annual period. Frequency should be 12 / year, duration should be 1 hour / meeting. The score is the actual vs benchmark ratio.</p>
			<p>We use the following evaluation procedures in the newly-released Help and Support Evaluation Procedure published as a companion to the Making Contnet Usable Protocol:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We have evaluated all content and ensured compliance with all relavant WCAG 3.0 methods and maintain a X conformance level for all web support offerings. <a href="#">See the results from our latest audit</a>.</li>
				<li>We offer live telephone support. To ensure all staff are properly trained in accessible communication methods, we require staff to take X curriculum and test all staff twice a year. Staff are required to acheive a score of at least X to serve customers.</li>
				<li>We hire people with disabilties sourced by X company to test our support processes annually. X company provides an indepdentant report and we remediate any findings from that testing within 90 days.</li>
				<li>To ensure even greater accessibility, Company X has developed Open A11y 100 software. This software lints code to help software developers implement new W3C standards, including ones related to personalization and content pronounciation.</li>
				<li>To ensure we meet the needs of everyone, we annually have X Company, who specializes in conformance beyond WCAG 3.0 methods to audit our web help options. <a href="#">See the results from our latest audit</a>. All findings are remediated within 180 days.</li>
				<li>For any customer who is unable to obtain support through our Help line or Portal, our company provides trained Customer Success Agents who work with the customer directly in the format they prefer. Our company records logs from those support cases and uses them to inform the design of new Help Portal features and in staff training/assessments.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>5. Scoring information</h2>
			<p>When implementation is demonstrated with the initial report, the relevant outcomes score at the lowest level of conformance.</p>
			<p>Note: higher conformance levels would require additional evaluation of the implementation procedures, beyond the baseline.</p>
