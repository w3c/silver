			<h2>2. Accessibility guidance</h2>
			<p>Organizations choose one or more of the following sets of human language-specific guidance that matches the site language:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>English: <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/">U.S. Federal Plain Language Guidelines</a></li>
				<li>Dutch: @@</li>
				<li>French: @@ </li>

			<h2>3. Implementation procedures</h2>
			<p>All roles (designer, coder, manager) read the accessibility guidance and take a half-day training session about how to implement it.</p>
			<p>The team conducts a 2-hour meeting to discuss how the guidance relates to their organizationâ€™s site, from each of their roles.</p>
			<p>A team member produces a short report describing attention points for the guidance.</p>
			<p>The team conducts monthly check-in meetings to discuss their progress on applying the guidance in their daily work, and to refine the plan.</p>
			<p>The team performs semi-annual reviews of the help and support resources available on the site.</p>
			<p>The organization maintains information about plain language writing on its internal resources site.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="evaluation-procedures">
			<h2>4. Evaluation procedures</h2>
			<p>The report describing attention points serves as a milestone that the procedure has been implemented.</p>
			<p>Frequency and duration of meetings related to the task are tracked for a given annual period. Frequency should be 12 / year, duration should be 1 hour / meeting. The score is the actual vs benchmark ratio.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="scoring-information">
			<h2>5. Scoring information</h2>
			<p>When implementation is demonstrated with the initial report, the relevant outcomes score at the lowest level of conformance.</p>
			<p>Note: higher conformance levels would require additional evaluation, possibly including direct evaluation of content.</p>
