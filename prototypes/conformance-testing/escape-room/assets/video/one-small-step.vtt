Armstrong: Getting back up to that first step, Buzz.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's ... The strut isn't collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up.

It's ... The strut isn't collapsed too far, but it's adequate...

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Armstrong: That's one small step for [a] man;
