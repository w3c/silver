  <h1>Blink element found</h1>
  <main>
    <blink>Blinking text and moving text (such as a marquee) can distract the reader's attention. This is especially relevant to people with attention deficits or cognitive disabilities. Neither is likely to cause a seizure, but they are likely to decrease the readability of the document as a whole and increase the time it takes for users to finish reading it.</blink>
