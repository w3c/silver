  <h1>Justified text found</h1>
  <main>
    <p class="justify">When text is justified to both margins it may add additional spaces between words which may be difficult for users with visual or cognitive impairments to read. Full text justification can also cause words to be spaced closely together thus making it difficult to determine where a word starts and ends.</p>
