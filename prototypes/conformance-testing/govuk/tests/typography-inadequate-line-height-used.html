  <h1>Inadequate line height used</h1>
  <main>
    <p class="line-height">Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble tracking lines of text when a block of text is single spaced. Providing spacing between 1.5 to 2 allows them to start a new line more easily once they have finished the previous one.</p>
