      <h1><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 3 Conformance Testing</h1>

      <p>There are currently four sites are available that can be used to test WCAG 3 conformance:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="escape-room/">Accessible Escape Room</a></li>
        <li><a href="login-form/">A login form</a></li>
        <li><a href="govuk/">The GOV UK suite of pages</a> originally created to test automated testing tools.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.myndex.com/APCA/">The APCA (Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm) visual contrast testing tool.</a></li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Accessible Escape Room</h2>
      <p>The Accessible Escape Room is a customized version of an existing site (reproduced with permission). The site has been altered to introduce content that falls under the scope of the the First Public Working Draft of WCAG 3.</p>
      
      <h2>Login Form</h2>
      <p>The login form has a number of pages that appear in a common user journey to to log into, or register with, a site. Note that none of the pages submit any kind of data.</p>
      
      <h2>GOV.UK Test Suite</h2>
      <p>These pages, reproduced under the MIT licence (our copy of which is available in this site's repo), were originally created to test various accessibility scanning tools. This <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/testing-for-accessibility">GOV.UK Testing For Accessibility article</a> has more information on that work.</p>

      <h2>APCA (Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm) visual contrast testing tool</h2>

      <p>This is a proof of concept prototype to test the new color contrast algorithm.</p>
