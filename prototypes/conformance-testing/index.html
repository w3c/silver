      <h1>Silver Conformance Testing</h1>

      <p>There are currently three sites that can be used to test Silver conformance:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="escape-room/">Accessible Escape Room</a></li>
        <li><a href="login-form/">A login form</a></li>
        <li><a href="govuk/">The GOV UK suite of pages</a> originally created to test automated testing tools.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Accessible Escape Room</h2>
      <p>The Accessible Escape Room is a customized version of an existing site (reproduced with permission). The site has been altered to introduce content that falls under the scope of the the First Public Working Draft of Silver.</p>
      
      <h2>Login Form</h2>
      <p>The login form has a number of pages that appear in a common user journey to to log into, or register with, a site. Note that none of the pages submit any kind of data.</p>
      
      <h2>GOV.UK Test Suite</h2>
      <p>These pages, reproduced under the MIT licence (our copy of which is available in this site's repo), were originally created to test various accessibility scanning tools. This <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/testing-for-accessibility">GOV.UK Testing For Accessibility article</a> has more information on that work.</p>
